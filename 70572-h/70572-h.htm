</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="fs80">A NARROW ESCAPE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bomba came to a sudden halt in the densest
part of the gigantic jungle.</p>

<p>A moment before he had been making his way
with surprising suppleness and ease through the
tangled brushwood, avoiding with equal dexterity
the vines that trailed from the branches of the
trees and the roots that reached out to trip him
up. Now he stood as though turned to stone.</p>

<p>Far overhead the sun beat down fiercely from
a brazen sky, though its rays were caught and
held by the heavy foliage, so that beneath the
branches of the trees semi-darkness prevailed.
But if the brightness of the sun was thus excluded,
its heat made itself felt, and masses of
steaming vapor rose from the lush vegetation
drenched by recent rains.</p>

<p>From a distance came the screams of parrots
and the howling of monkeys, but otherwise the
jungle was silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>It had not been silent a moment before. From
a point toward which Bomba was facing had come
a sound that was new to the jungle and almost
new to Bomba—a sound he had heard but twice.
And each of those times was indelibly graven on
his memory.</p>

<p>Once had been when Casson had brought down
the savage jaguar with the iron stick or “rifle,” as
Casson had called it. The beast had been crouching
on the limb of a tree beneath which Bomba
had sat down to rest. He had not seen the creature,
whose huge body had been flattened close
against the bough.</p>

<p>He had had no intimation of danger until he
had seen the startled look in the eyes of Casson
and heard his shout of warning. Then he had
leaped to his feet. At the same instant the jaguar
sprang. But Casson drew the iron stick to
his shoulder, and a flame leaped from the end of
it, accompanied by a sharp report.</p>

<p>The beast whirled about in mid-air and fell to
the ground, one of its outstretched claws grazing
Bomba’s leg as the latter sprang aside. The
jaguar writhed and twisted about for a moment
and then lay still.</p>

<p>When Bomba was sure the creature was dead,
he had approached and examined it curiously.
He had seen the natives kill game with arrows,
and he half expected to see some missile protruding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
from the body. But there was no sign of
this—only a tiny hole through the center of its
forehead, from which blood was oozing.</p>

<p>He had questioned Casson curiously, but the
latter was in one of his silent moods that day and
gave no explanation. But the convulsive way in
which he had strained Bomba to his breast told
how deeply he had been stirred by the narrow
escape.</p>

<p>The other time and the last that Bomba had
witnessed the work of the iron stick had been when
a giant anaconda had reared its horrid head in
front of Bomba and darted forward to enclose
him in its folds. Again Casson had fired, but this
time instead of a loud crack there had been a
thunderous roar, and the stick had exploded into
a thousand fragments. Casson had fallen over
on his back. The great snake, frightened by the
noise and struck by some of the flying bits of iron,
had hastily retreated. Bomba, who had escaped
with some scratches, had managed to get the unconscious
Casson back to the hut in which they
dwelt, and there the old man had lain for many
days, nursed by Bomba and treated with some of
the simple remedies he had learned from the
natives.</p>

<p>Casson had finally recovered, but had never
again been the same. His head had been injured
by the explosion, and his memory, which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
failing for some time, now almost wholly disappeared.
At times he had flashes of recollection of
his old life, but these were few and transient.
Most of the time he was wrapped in moody
silence, and Bomba felt more alone than ever.</p>

<p>But this had happened years ago, and the sound
of the iron stick had almost passed from Bomba’s
memory. Now he heard it again, and his pulses
leaped.</p>

<p>It came from a distance perhaps half a mile
away. Who had fired the stick? He knew that
none of the natives had any weapon of the kind.
Could it be some man like Casson, a man with a
white skin like Casson’s and his own?</p>

<p>A white skin! Something tugged at Bomba’s
heart. He could not have told what it was. It
might have been memory, intuition, instinct. But
whatever it was, it took instant and entire possession
of him.</p>

<p>He must find out who had fired the iron stick!</p>

<p>The primal law of the jungle is to mind one’s
own business. Intrusion on the affairs of another
is never welcomed and usually resented. Bomba
had learned to obey that law.</p>

<p>Ordinarily he would have given a wide berth
to the locality from which the sound had come,
swerved aside, and plunged deeper into the jungle.
Where the iron stick sounded there was probably
danger. It was associated in his mind with deadly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
beasts and reptiles. There was trouble enough in
the jungle without looking for it.</p>

<p>Why, then, did he depart from all his usual
caution and begin making his way toward the spot
from which the sound had come?</p>

<p>He did not know. A confused tumult of
thoughts and longings swept through his brain.
He was conscious of a desperate urge that impelled
him in that direction; and that urge came
from the profoundest depths of his soul.</p>

<p>A white man must have fired that iron stick.
The stick itself had some appeal to his curiosity.
He would like to see it again—that mysterious
thing that killed like magic from a distance.</p>

<p>But that desire was not compelling. Had he
thought a native had fired it, he would not have
risked intruding on what might be a hostile hunting
party, possibly some of the dreaded head-hunters
that occasionally invaded this region.</p>

<p>No, it was the craving to see a man with a white
skin like his own, like Casson’s, that drew him on,
drew him with a power he could no more resist
than a chip could stem the current of Niagara.</p>

<p>To be sure, the white man might prove hostile.
The deadly fire stick might be turned on himself.
But he did not believe this. Casson had always
been kind to him. All white men would be. Were
they not his own kind? Was he not their brother?
A wild surge of yearning swept over him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>All the longings he had felt so often, that came
to him with increasing intensity day and night, that
he had never been able to analyze and understand
came to a head at the report of the iron stick. He
could not resist them. He did not want to resist
them.</p>

<p>He must see the man with the white skin!</p>

<p>Bomba was a striking figure as he worked his
way through the jungle over sprawling roots and
through a network of vines, gradually drawing
closer to the spot from which the sound had come.</p>

<p>He was nothing more than a boy, fourteen
years at most, of a little above the ordinary height
at that age, compact and muscular. He had
brown eyes and brown wavy hair and the whitest
of teeth. His skin was darkly tanned by exposure
to the sun.</p>

<p>On his feet were rude home-made sandals, and
around his body was wrapped a bit of native cloth
and a small puma-skin—the skin of Geluk, the
puma, who had tried to eat the friendly parrots,
Kiki and Woowoo. Bomba had caught him in the
attempt and killed him with an arrow.</p>

<p>The skin heightened the resemblance of Bomba
to a young panther as, light and supple, the
muscles of arms and legs rippling under the
bronzed skin, he threaded his way deftly through
the underbrush.</p>

<p>Bomba lived with an old naturalist, Cody Casson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
in the depths of the Amazonian jungle, so
remote from civilization that it was rarely if ever
visited by white men. Of his past he knew
nothing, and so far Casson had told him next to
nothing. He had given the boy some rudiments
of education, especially in his own line of botany
and natural history, but even this teaching had
ceased years before when the old naturalist’s mind
had been weakened by the exploding rifle.</p>

<p>Bomba knew nothing of the world at large,
nothing of the white race to which he belonged,
little even of the life of the natives of the region.
For the pair did not mingle much with the latter
and were themselves shunned by the superstitious
natives, who had got the idea from the old naturalist’s
queer actions that he was a Man of Evil.</p>

<p>Two eyes of which he was not aware were
watching Bomba as he approached a narrow part
of the rude native trail he was following, wicked
eyes, malignant eyes glowing with lurid fires.</p>

<p>The eyes were set in the swaying head of a
cooanaradi, the most terrible serpent on earth.</p>

<p>It lay in its lair just beside the path that
Bomba was following, its body, fourteen feet in
length, thrown into coils, above which the slender
head swayed back and forth. Evilly beautiful,
it glowed with all the colors of the rainbow.</p>

<p>Had it been a rattlesnake or any other poisonous
denizen of the jungle, it would have glided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
away into the bushes, glad enough to avoid an
encounter with human enemies unless attacked.
Even the boa or the anaconda is apathetic and,
except when moved by hunger, seldom takes the
initiative.</p>

<p>But what makes the cooanaradi so dreaded,
apart from its deadly poison, is its ferocity. It
does not avoid attack; it seeks to make it. Nor is
it satisfied when its enemy flees; it follows in
pursuit.</p>

<p>But there was no need yet for that. All unsuspecting,
its prey was coming toward it. Soon
he would be in reach of the lightning stroke. The
evil eyes gloated in anticipation.</p>

<p>Then, when Bomba was barely ten feet away,
he saw it!</p>

<p>There was no time to string his arrow. There
was no time to draw his machete. Even while he
looked, the snake launched its spring.</p>

<p>Like a flash Bomba turned and ran for his life!</p>

<span class="fs80">THE MEN WITH THE IRON STICK</span></h2>
</div>

<p>At the moment that Bomba made his first
startled leap he heard close behind him the thud
of a body as it struck the earth. The reptile had
missed its spring.</p>

<p>But this brought Bomba small comfort. He
knew that the fight had just begun, that behind
him death was coming and traveling fast.</p>

<p>One look was all he cast behind him, but that
was sufficient to show the slithering long body of
his implacable foe moving swiftly along the trail.</p>

<p>Bomba was agile and fleet of foot, and he tore
along at an astounding rate of speed. But he
knew too much of his adversary to believe that he
could distance it. In the long run, the endurance
of the snake would outlast that of the fugitive.</p>

<p>But if Bomba’s feet were fast, so was his
brain, and it was working now with lightning
rapidity. It was recalling every turn and oddity
of the trail along which he was speeding.</p>

<p>There were plenty of trees, but before he could
get a grip and begin to climb, the fearful thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
would be upon him. And even if he had sufficient
start to avoid the first stroke, the snake could
climb much more rapidly than Bomba could dream
of doing.</p>

<p>Had there been a stream at hand, he would
have plunged into it, although he might have
become the prey of some lurking cayman or been
torn to bits by the fierce piranhas. Either of
those fates would have been a possibility. But he
would at least have had a chance of not being
attacked, while, unless he could escape from the
cooanaradi, death was a certainty.</p>

<p>At times, when he came to a little opening, he
would dart off to the right or the left, so as to
disconcert the enemy. This had the desired effect
more than once, and enabled him to get some space
ahead before the snake was again at full speed
on his trail.</p>

<p>Bomba’s breath was fast failing him, but his
courage and mental alertness still remained. Then
he caught sight of something that gave him a
gleam of hope.</p>

<p>It was a thick, matted mass of whiplike
streamers hanging from one of the trees. It
spread out like a huge fan with narrow interstices
between the tough withes. Behind this screen he
darted like a flash and stood there panting, facing
the enemy.</p>

<p>The cooanaradi was not twenty feet away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
coming at tremendous speed, its eyes red with
fury. As it approached, Bomba thrust his face
against the screen and shouted.</p>

<p>What he had hoped came to pass. The snake,
infuriated at the challenge, reared and struck at
the face of his foe. Bomba dodged, and the
opened jaws of the snake caught and in turn were
held by the matted mass into which the fangs had
sunk.</p>

<p>It writhed wildly and tried to extricate itself.
But in an instant Bomba had leaped to the other
side of the screen. His hands worked like lightning,
deftly winding the withes like cords around
the twisting body, until it was securely enmeshed in
a net from which there was no escape.</p>

<p>Only when he had made sure of his victory did
Bomba desist and stand panting a little distance
off, watching the unavailing efforts of the captive
to free itself.</p>

<p>Craft and cunning had triumphed over the
fiend of the jungle. The boy had had a narrow
escape from one of the most terrible of deaths,
and he owed it solely to his own speedy feet and
active brain.</p>

<p>He was drenched with perspiration from head
to foot. His lungs were strained almost to
bursting. His breath came in great gasping sobs.
But he had won, and every nerve tingled with
exultation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>His hand slid to the handle of his machete, a
formidable double-edged knife ground to almost
a razor’s sharpness and fully a foot in length.</p>

<p>But after a moment’s reflection he slipped the
partly drawn weapon back in his belt. A slash
at the snake might sever some of the withes with
which it was bound, only wound the reptile and
permit it to get free.</p>

<p>No, the jungle itself could be trusted to finish
the work begun by the boy. The peccaries, or
wild pigs, would happen along, and to them a
snake was the daintiest of foods.</p>

<p>Or there were the vultures. Bomba cast his
eyes upward through an opening in the trees and
saw one of these rapacious creatures circling about
and slowly descending, already attracted by that
almost miraculous instinct that tells the carrion
eaters where death has come or is imminent.</p>

<p>And even the vulture would have to come
soon, or a swarm of ants would be going over the
reptile stripping the flesh from the bones.</p>

<p>In the excitement of the flight and pursuit,
Bomba had forgotten for the moment the object
of his quest. Now it came back to him with the
force of a shock.</p>

<p>The white man with the iron stick! Could
he find him now? Or was he too late?</p>

<p>He cast one glance at his captive to make sure
that it was securely held. Then having satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
himself on this point, hurriedly resumed his
journey.</p>

<p>But he did not follow the same path on which
he had found the cooanaradi. He knew that
these reptiles usually traveled in pairs, and he had
no desire to encounter the mate of the one that
had so nearly proved his doom.</p>

<p>So he made a wide detour, although he bitterly
resented the necessity of doing so, for now a fear
that was almost panic assailed him that he might
miss meeting the man with the iron stick. It was
already late in the afternoon, and unless he came
upon him before darkness set in, he would probably
fail altogether in finding him. And this
possibility had by this time assumed the proportions
of a calamity.</p>

<p>Why he should lay such stress on this was more
than Bomba could explain, even to himself. But
the fact was there. He must find this man!</p>

<p>There was no trail in the direction he had been
forced to choose, and often he had to hack his
way through the underbrush with his machete.
It was laborious and exhausting work, and it was
nearly an hour before he caught a scent of roasting
meat that told him he was in the vicinity of some
human inhabitant of the wilds.</p>

<p>Now he worked with extreme caution, for he
was by no means sure of his reception, and he
wanted, from the safe seclusion of the jungle, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
form his own ideas of conditions before venturing
into the open.</p>

<p>A few minutes more of stealthy approach, and
he heard the sound of voices. Some of these he
recognized at once as those of natives.</p>

<p>But there were other tongues too, and with a
thrill he realized that they were speaking the same
language that he and Casson used and that he had
never yet heard from other lips! Some of the
words he could not understand, but the simpler
ones were familiar.</p>

<p>He tingled with delight. He was not then too
late. The white man was there. He could look
upon him, devour him with his avid eyes, perhaps
speak with him!</p>

<p>A moment later he reached the fringe of the
heavier jungle. Beyond, it widened out into a
glade of considerable extent.</p>

<p>He dropped on his knees and wormed his way
to a great tree near the edge. Then, lying flat on
the ground, he carefully parted the underbrush and
peered through.</p>

<p>He saw at once that he had come upon a considerable
party. A rude tent had been pitched in
the center of the glade, a number of packs littered
the ground, and a dozen natives were engaged at
various tasks. A fire had been built, and some
freshly cut steaks of meat, stuck on spits, were
being roasted by native cooks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Bomba gave these but a cursory glance. His
eyes were riveted on two men, one tall and gaunt,
the other stocky and muscular, who sat on adjoining
stumps conversing with each other. One
was cleaning and oiling an iron stick. The other
was skinning the body of an animal the size of a
calf that Bomba recognized from its coarse hair
and blackish brown hide as that of a tapir, whose
life had evidently been taken by the shot that
Bomba had heard.</p>

<p>The faces of the men were bronzed, but their
shirts were open at the throat, and Bomba could
see the white skin like his own and Casson’s.</p>

<p>Again that strange thrill shot through him and
he had all he could do to repress a shout of
delight.</p>

<p>He scanned their faces closely. They were
keen faces, alight with intelligence. How different,
Bomba thought, from the vacuous faces of
the natives who surrounded them. To him they
seemed like visitants from another sphere.</p>

<p>And they were kindly faces. The men were
laughing and joking with each other, evidently in
the best of spirits. There was nothing there that
need arouse fear in any but evil-doers. His heart
warmed with a sense of kinship.</p>

<p>Impulsively he rose to go out into the clearing.
Then he sank down again. Shyness, reticence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
caution, the restraint bred of the jungle! He
longed to show himself, yet he shrank back.</p>

<p>His problem was solved for him. His sudden
movement had caught the keen eye of a native.
Instantly the fellow shrilled an alarm.</p>

<p>The white men snatched their iron sticks and
sprang to their feet.</p>

<p>The die was cast! Bomba leaped out into the
open!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="fs80">A STEALTHY FOE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>An exclamation of surprise came from the white
men as Bomba advanced toward them with his
upraised palms, extended as a sign of amity, and
they lowered their rifles.</p>

<p>“Just an Indian kid!” remarked the stockier of
the two with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Indian nothing!” retorted the other, as his
keen eyes swept the lad. “Look at his hair, his
eyes, his features. He’s as white as we are, or my
name isn’t Gillis. Look again, Dorn.”</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right, old man,” conceded Jake
Dorn, after a close scrutiny. “But what in the
mischief is he doing here? I didn’t know there
were any other whites within a thousand miles of
us.”</p>

<p>“Neither did I,” replied Ralph Gillis. “But we
were evidently wrong. Probably he belongs to
some other camp of rubber hunters not far away.”</p>

<p>“But look at his clothes, if you can call them
clothes,” said Dorn, with a puzzled air. “I never
saw a white boy dressed like that. Nothing but
a clout and a puma skin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll soon solve the mystery,” said Gillis.
“Come here, boy,” he added kindly.</p>

<p>Bomba came shyly toward him.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked Gillis.</p>

<p>“Bomba,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Bomba!” repeated Gillis, with a frown of perplexity.
“That’s a queer name for a white boy.
For you are white, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Bomba proudly, as he drew
aside the puma skin and exhibited his chest.</p>

<p>“And since you understand what I say to you,
you must be either American or English,” pursued
Gillis. “What is your other name?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any,” was the reply. “I am Bomba.”</p>

<p>The men exchanged puzzled glances.</p>

<p>“Who are your folks?” put in Dorn.</p>

<p>Bomba pondered for a moment.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what that word means,” he
replied simply.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” exclaimed Gillis. “I
mean your father, your mother.”</p>

<p>“I guess I never had any,” replied Bomba. “I
never saw them or heard of them.”</p>

<p>“The poor kid!” murmured Dorn.</p>

<p>“But you must have somebody to live with or
take care of you,” said Gillis.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Bomba, “I live with Cody
Casson.”</p>

<p>“Who is he and where is he?” asked Gillis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“He is an old man,” answered Bomba. “He
lives in a hut a long way off,” and he pointed
toward the south.</p>

<p>“Is he a relation of yours?” asked Dorn.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what that means,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>Gillis threw up his hands in despair.</p>

<p>“Well, wouldn’t that get your goat?” he
ejaculated.</p>

<p>“I haven’t got any goat,” replied Bomba,
who thought the question was addressed to him.</p>

<p>The men laughed heartily, and Bomba, though
a little puzzled, laughed with them. He was glad
that he had said something that pleased them.
They were nice men. His heart warmed to them.</p>

<p>Gillis returned to the attack.</p>

<p>“When did you come into this jungle?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I have always been here,” answered Bomba.</p>

<p>“But don’t you remember ever living anywhere
else?” persisted Gillis. “Don’t you remember
coming over the ocean?”</p>

<p>“What is the ocean?” asked Bomba.</p>

<p>“It is like a river, but a thousand times as big,”
explained his questioner.</p>

<p>Bomba shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “I never saw any water I could
not swim across.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever heard of England or America?”
put in Dorn.</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply. “There are no animals
here that have those names.”</p>

<p>A glance of pity passed between the two men.</p>

<p>“An untutored child of nature, if there ever
was one!” exclaimed Gillis. “How in heaven’s
name do you explain it?”</p>

<p>“Search me!” replied Dorn. “Seems to me the
only thing to do is to hunt up this fellow Casson
and get it out of him. The boy ought to be taken
out to civilization and have his chance.”</p>

<p>“He ought,” assented Gillis. “Though I don’t
see how we can do anything just now, for our
road lies in the opposite direction and we’re behind
our schedule now. We’ve <em>got</em> to get to the
coast in time to get that steamer. But later on
we’ll take the matter up ourselves or have some
of the authorities look into it. But those steaks
are done now, and I’m as hungry as a wolf. This
young visitor of ours shall fill up too, if he cares
to stop and eat with us.”</p>

<p>Bomba gladly accepted the invitation, not only
because he was hungry but because it gave him a
chance to stay in the company of the white men.
He would have liked to stay with them forever.
The thought of parting filled him with dread.</p>

<p>They brought knives and forks from their kit
and offered one of each to Bomba. But he did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
know their use, had never seen them, and ate his
meat by plucking it apart with his teeth and
fingers, as was his custom, the while he watched
with wonder the deft way in which the table
utensils were used by his new acquaintances.</p>

<p>He felt that it must be a better way than his.
The white men did it, and he himself was white
and ought to do it too. Before he was half way
through the meal, he shyly reached out for the
knife and fork and tried to imitate them. The
effort was not very successful, but they sensed
his feeling, and be it said to their credit they did
not laugh.</p>

<p>The meal was interspersed with questionings,
in the course of which the men learned much and
gained marked respect for Bomba’s courage and
self-reliance. They were aghast at his story of the
way he had trapped the cooanaradi, and would
not have believed it had not the simple way that
Bomba told it carried conviction. He did not
boast, merely narrated the incident as though
it were not of any particular importance and
simply a part of the day’s work in the jungle.</p>

<p>“Why not take the boy along with us, if he’s
willing?” suggested Gillis, thoughtfully, to his
companion. “It would bring him out to civilization,
and at the same time he’d be a mighty
valuable addition to our party. We’d be killing
two birds with one stone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“Right enough,” agreed Dorn. “How would
you like to go along with us?” he asked, addressing
himself to Bomba.</p>

<p>The boy’s heart leaped and delight shone in his
eyes. Oh, how he wanted to go! But the next
moment the light faded and his heart sank.</p>

<p>“I could not leave Casson,” he said. “He
would die if I left him alone.”</p>

<p>“The boy’s true blue,” said Gillis, “and we
mustn’t tempt him. But soon or late we’ll see this
Casson and perhaps get them both out of the
jungle. The whole thing is the queerest affair
I ever came across.”</p>

<p>He struck a match to light his pipe, and Bomba
jumped at the sudden spurt of flame.</p>

<p>“Never see one of those before?” asked Dorn,
in surprise.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Bomba. “I make fire like this.”</p>

<p>He took a stick and a tiny wooden bowl from
his belt, twirled the stick dexterously, and in a few
moments produced a spark.</p>

<p>“Well done!” cried Dorn admiringly.</p>

<p>Bomba was pleased at the note of approbation,
but in his heart he knew that the white men’s way
was quicker and better. He looked longingly at
the matches, and Gillis, with a smile, handed him
a box of them, which Bomba grasped eagerly and
thrust into the small pouch at his belt. Now he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
could make fire as the white men did. He felt
that he was growing closer to them.</p>

<p>Gillis showed him his rifle. It was a far finer
iron stick than Casson’s had been, and Bomba
examined it with the greatest curiosity.</p>

<p>He did not in the least understand the principle
of it, but he knew its power. The dead tapir was
evidence of it, as well as his memory of the way a
similar stick had slain the jaguar.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you how it works,” volunteered
Gillis, noting the boy’s eager interest in the
weapon.</p>

<p>Bomba nodded delightedly. This was what he
had been wishing for ever since he had reached
the camp, but had been too shy to ask of his own
accord.</p>

<p>Ralph Gillis took a card and tacked it up against
a tree about fifty feet away, Bomba watching him
intently.</p>

<p>Then Gillis took up his position and raised the
rifle to his shoulder. Bomba, with a lively recollection
of what had happened when Casson had
fired at the anaconda, edged some distance away.</p>

<p>There was a sharp crack, and Bomba’s keen
eyes noticed a slight quivering of the card.</p>

<p>“Come along,” said Gillis, beckoning to the
boy, and Bomba followed him to the tree, where
he saw a small hole in the card that had not been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
there before. But he looked in vain for any sign
of scorching.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t the fire burn it?” he asked.</p>

<p>Gillis looked at him perplexedly, and then
laughed as he grasped his meaning.</p>

<p>“Bless you,” he said, “it wasn’t the fire you
saw coming from the muzzle that struck the card.
It was a cartridge just like this,” and he drew one
of the pellets from his belt.</p>

<p>Bomba examined it curiously.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t I see this when you fired the iron
stick?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It went too fast for you to see,” explained
Gillis patiently.</p>

<p>“You could see my arrow if I shot it,” said
Bomba.</p>

<p>“That’s different,” said Gillis. “The arrow is
bigger, and it doesn’t go as fast. And it doesn’t
go as straight, either.”</p>

<p>“It goes straight,” declared Bomba.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you could hit that
card?” asked Dorn incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bomba.</p>

<p>“I’m from Missouri,” remarked Gillis.</p>

<p>“Where is that?” asked Bomba.</p>

<p>The men laughed.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Gillis. “Let’s see you hit
the card.”</p>

<p>Bomba drew an arrow from his belt, fitted it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the string, and, scarcely appearing to take aim,
let it go.</p>

<p>A cry of surprise broke from his new acquaintances
as they saw the arrow standing out straight
from the center of the card.</p>

<p>“The boy’s a wonder!” cried Gillis.</p>

<p>“Robin Hood had nothing on him!” declared
Dorn.</p>

<p>“Who was he?” asked Bomba. “And why did
he have nothing on him?” as he glanced at the
well-clothed forms of the white men.</p>

<p>“I can see that we’ll have to cut out slang,”
laughed Dorn. “Robin Hood was a great shot
with the bow and arrow, and what I meant to say
was that you could shoot as straight as he could.”</p>

<p>Bomba’s heart swelled with pride at the approbation
of the white men. It seemed to him the
sweetest music he had ever heard.</p>

<p>Dusk was drawing on now, and the forest began
to waken. From the lairs in which they
had lain during the heat of the day wild beasts
rose, yawned, stretched themselves, and then
stalked out on their nocturnal search for prey.
Death was abroad.</p>

<p>Two or three times, as Bomba sat by the tent
of his new-made friends, he raised his head and
sniffed the air.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Gillis curiously, after the
third repetition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“Jaguars,” answered Bomba.</p>

<p>The men grasped their rifles and peered into
the darkening forest surrounding them.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any,” remarked Gillis, after a
moment.</p>

<p>“They see you,” replied Bomba.</p>

<p>The calm matter-of-fact statement sent a little
chill down their spines.</p>

<p>“How do you know there are any about?” asked
Dorn.</p>

<p>“I smell them,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“On what side of the camp are they?” queried
Gillis.</p>

<p>“All sides,” said Bomba.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="fs80">HOW BOMBA SAVED THE CAMP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The men sprang to their feet at this ominous
declaration and their eyes swept the forest in
every direction.</p>

<p>“And the boy speaks of this as calmly as though
it meant nothing to him or us!” exclaimed Jake
Dorn.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he really knows what he is talking
about,” cried Gillis. “Tell me,” he demanded
turning to Bomba, “what makes you think there
are jaguars all about us?”</p>

<p>“I smell them and I hear them,” returned Bomba.
“First I heard them a long way off. They
were screaming. Then they came nearer, and they
were snarling. Now they are nearer still, and they
are purring. I hear them.”</p>

<p>“More than I do, then,” said Gillis, after a few
moments, when he and his comrade had listened
with all their ears. “But I’ve heard some wonderful
stories of the smell and hearing of those who
have lived long in the jungle, and perhaps the boy
is right. If he is, we’ve got a fight on our hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
all right. When is this little shindig going to
take place?” he asked Bomba grimly, as his hand
tightened on the stock of his rifle.</p>

<p>“I do not know shindig,” answered Bomba.</p>

<p>“When will the jaguars try to kill us?” asked
Dorn.</p>

<p>“Not for a long while,” replied Bomba. “Not
till it gets very dark and many more come.”</p>

<p>“That’s cheerful,” muttered Gillis.</p>

<p>“They smell the blood of the tapir,” Bomba
went on. “Then they come and see many men
here. Much meat for the jaguars.”</p>

<p>“We’ll leave out those pleasant little details,”
said Dorn, repressing a shudder. “It seems likely
that we’re in for the fight of our lives, and you and
I will have to do the most of the fighting, Gillis.
These natives aren’t good for anything.”</p>

<p>“I will help,” said Bomba.</p>

<p>“By ginger, I believe the boy will!” exclaimed
Gillis. “He’s as plucky as a wildcat. Though I’m
afraid that bow and arrow won’t do much against
such beasts.”</p>

<p>“I have my machete,” Bomba reminded them,
half drawing the gleaming weapon from its
leather sheath.</p>

<p>“I’m blest if the little rascal isn’t thinking of
fighting them hand to hand!” ejaculated Gillis in
admiration.</p>

<p>“I do not want to, but I will if I have to,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Bomba. “It is better to kill than be killed. But
wait, I think of something.”</p>

<p>While he had been talking, his eyes had been
roving among the trees that edged the clearing,
and they lighted as they fell on a tree with triangular
pointed leaves.</p>

<p>He pointed to a pail that was lying near one of
the packs.</p>

<p>“Let me have that,” he said, pointing to it.</p>

<p>“What do you want of it?” asked Dorn.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother with questions,” suggested Gillis.
“The boy has something in mind, and after
what I’ve seen of him I’m willing to give him a
free hand. Here it is,” handing the pail to him.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Bomba, “make the fire big. The
jaguars will go back from the light. I have to go
into the woods. I do not want them so near.”</p>

<p>Gillis gave a few sharp orders to the natives
and they heaped brush on the fire, which had been
allowed to die down, and soon it was crackling
fiercely, sending a broader zone of light through
the surrounding forest.</p>

<p>This made the immediate proximity safe for the
time, and Bomba took the pail and started out for
the tree he had discerned.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t one or both of us better go with
you?” asked Dorn anxiously. “It isn’t right to
let you go in there alone.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bomba. “I must do my work myself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
You can keep the iron sticks ready. But
you will not need them yet.”</p>

<p>He took the pail and went unhesitatingly into
the woods. The heavy underbrush closed behind
him and swallowed him up, though the lurid
glare of the fire gave those in the camp occasional
glimpses of his progress.</p>

<p>Bomba made his way toward the tree he
sought, and, reaching it, set down the pail and
drew his machete.</p>

<p>He drove the knife through the bark and into
the body of the tree as far as his strength permitted.
Then he drew the knife down in a long
vertical slash.</p>

<p>He pulled the blade out, lifted the pail, held
it under the cut and waited.</p>

<p>In a few moments a sticky sap began to exude
from the tree, at first slowly, and then more
rapidly. Soon it was trickling in a thin stream
into the pail.</p>

<p>It was eerie work waiting there, where he knew
that greenish-yellow eyes were watching him from
the jungle, only deterred for the moment from
coming nearer by the light that came from the
fire. But Bomba had learned patience in the hard
school of the jungle, and he stood like a statue,
the pail in one hand, his machete in the other
ready for instant use, until the receptacle was
nearly full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>Then he took it and, tilting it slightly so that a
thin but steady stream fell on the leaves that
carpeted the jungle, he made the circuit of the
camp.</p>

<p>The white rubber hunters caught sight of him at
intervals during his course, and watched his progress
with bated breath.</p>

<p>“What on earth do you suppose the boy is
doing?” asked Dorn.</p>

<p>“Looks as though he were weaving some magic
charm out there,” muttered Gillis. “Something
perhaps that he has learned from the witch doctors
of the region. It’s making me creepy! It’s
uncanny!”</p>

<p>The men were immensely relieved when Bomba
at last emerged from the shadows, put down his
empty pail, and seated himself on a stump near
them.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing?” asked Gillis.</p>

<p>Bomba picked up the pail.</p>

<p>“Feel,” he said, pointing to the interior.</p>

<p>Gillis put his finger on the bottom of the pail,
and when he withdrew it, it was covered with a
pale, yellow, sticky substance. It felt uncomfortable,
and he tried to rub it off with a bit of cloth.
But this he found was almost impossible.</p>

<p>“Sticks closer than a brother,” he muttered.
“What is it and where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“From the tree,” replied Bomba. “I stuck my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
knife in the tree and hurt it. The tree wept.
These are the tears of the tree.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Dorn, “the boy’s a poet.”</p>

<p>“Right enough,” agreed Gillis. “What he
means, of course, is that he tapped the tree and
got this gum-like sap from it. But why did you
do it and what have you done with most of the
sap?” he asked, addressing himself to Bomba.</p>

<p>“I spilled it on the leaves all around the camp,”
said Bomba. “It is good for us and bad for the
jaguars.”</p>

<p>The men looked at each other in perplexity.</p>

<p>“Can you make out what he’s getting at?”
asked Dorn of his companion.</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” replied Gillis. “It’s all
Greek to me. How is it bad for the jaguars?”
he asked Bomba.</p>

<p>“The jaguars step on it,” explained Bomba.
“The leaves stick to their feet. They try to shake
them off. But the leaves stick. Then they try to
rub them off with their heads. The leaves stick to
their heads. The gum gets in their eyes. It is
bitter. It makes them blind. They get frightened.
They cannot see where they are going.
They forget all about the white man and the meat.
They cry. They run. That is all.”</p>

<p>The men looked at each other, struck dumb
with amazement.</p>

<p>“That is all!” exclaimed Gillis, when he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
recovered his breath. “By ginger, it’s enough!”</p>

<p>“I should say it was,” agreed Dorn. “Boy, I
take off my hat to you.”</p>

<p>As he was bareheaded at the moment, Bomba
was a little puzzled at this, but he sensed the warm
approval of the white men, and his heart rejoiced.
He, too, was white, and he had made his brothers
happy.</p>

<p>He thought it well, however, to add a word of
warning.</p>

<p>“You must keep the iron sticks ready,” he said.
“Most of the jaguars will be stopped by the gum.
But some of them, maybe one, two, three, will
miss the leaves that stick and they will get into the
camp.”</p>

<p>“We can probably handle them,” said Gillis.
“At any rate we’ll do our best. I only wish we
had more brushwood to keep the fire going strong.
But we hadn’t counted on this wholesale raid, and
now it would be as much as one’s life was worth
to go into the forest for more. We’ll have to
worry along as best we can.”</p>

<p>Having to husband their resources, they could
only maintain a moderate fire, and as the hours
wore on they had to be still more economical in
feeding it.</p>

<p>As the zone of light narrowed they knew that
their enemies were creeping closer, waiting only
for the most opportune moment of attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>They had put the camp into the best position
for defense that circumstances permitted. The
natives had been warned of the danger and had
spears and arrows ready, though the white men
knew that they would be far more ready to run
than fight when the pinch came.</p>

<p>Toward midnight a sudden spitting and snarling
rose on one side of the camp, to be taken up
shortly on the other. There came the sound of
heavy bodies rolling about in the underbrush and
crashing through thickets. All the natural caution
of the cat tribe seemed to have been abandoned
in a rush of panic terror. The snarls and roars
swelled into a hideous din that made the natives
quake with fear, but that the white men understood.</p>

<p>Bomba’s spell was working!</p>

<p>But though they exulted, they did not abate one
jot of their vigilance.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for them that they did not,
for a few minutes later a huge, tawny body came
hurtling through the air, landed within twenty feet
of Gillis, and crouched for a second spring.</p>

<p>Two rifles spoke simultaneously with the twang
of Bomba’s bow. The jaguar quivered, rolled
over on its side, and lay still.</p>

<p>While their eyes were still fastened on it there
came a roar from another direction, and a second
jaguar landed behind Gillis and Dorn. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
turned and fired, but so hurriedly that they either
missed or only slightly wounded the animal. Before
they could fire again it would be upon them!
They dodged and clubbed their rifles, horror-stricken,
awaiting the attack.</p>

<p>Like a flash Bomba drew his machete.</p>

<p>The beast launched itself in the air.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<span class="fs80">BEATEN OFF</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Through the air whizzed a gleaming, long,
razor-edged knife that buried itself in the jaguar’s
throat!</p>

<p>The stricken jaguar landed on the spot where
but a moment before, Gillis and Dorn had stood,
and sprawled out in a heap. It made one or two
frantic digs at its throat in the attempt to dislodge
the machete. But it had gone deep and the beast’s
efforts were unavailing. A few convulsive struggles,
and it was dead.</p>

<p>Amazed at this sudden end of their foe, the
men approached it cautiously and prodded it with
the butts of their guns. But there was no movement.
The knife had done its work effectively.</p>

<p>Dorn’s eyes caught sight of the handle of the
weapon, and he stooped down and drew it out,
though he had to tug hard to get it. He held it
up before his astonished companion.</p>

<p>“How did this get there?” asked Gillis.</p>

<p>“It is mine,” said Bomba, coming up and reaching
out his hand to reclaim it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Yours?” demanded Dorn. “Why, you weren’t
near enough to stab the beast!”</p>

<p>“I threw it,” said Bomba, wiping the knife on
the grass and slipping it back into his belt.</p>

<p>“G—great Scott!” stuttered Dorn. “He—he
threw it!”</p>

<p>“And threw it as straight as he shot the arrow!”
ejaculated Gillis. “And with so much force that
you had all that you could do to draw it out. Boy,
you’re a wonder! You saved the life of one or
both of us!”</p>

<p>“I was glad to help you,” said Bomba, showing
all his white teeth in a happy smile. “But now we
must put the jaguars near the edge of the woods
where the others will see them.”</p>

<p>“What’s the idea?” queried Gillis. “So that
they can’t feast on them and not be so hungry
after us?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bomba. “The others will not eat
them. They fight and kill each other when they
are angry, but they do not eat one another. But
when the live ones see these dead ones, they will
know that this place is not good for jaguars, and
they will go away.”</p>

<p>“Sounds reasonable,” said Gillis. “But whether
the plan works or not, what this boy says goes.
I’m frank to confess that he’s got me buffaloed.
If he hadn’t been here to-night, you and I would
have been dead men, Dorn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“He’s saved the camp all right,” assented Dorn,
as he directed some of the natives to drag the
heavy bodies to the places that Bomba indicated.</p>

<p>That the sight of their dead kindred daunted
whatever other jaguars might have intended to
make an onslaught on the camp, seemed clear as
time went on. The jungle was vocal, as it always
is at night, with the strident notes of insects, the
howling of monkeys, and now and then the distant
bellow of an anaconda.</p>

<p>But the jaguars seemed to have taken themselves
off. Bomba’s keen ears could no longer
detect the subdued growling and purring of the
four-footed raiders, the soft thud of their padding
feet. Nor were his nostrils conscious of their
presence.</p>

<p>After a full hour had passed, he relaxed his
tense attitude, stretched, and yawned.</p>

<p>“They have gone,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked Gillis, eagerly.</p>

<p>“They have gone,” repeated Bomba. “And
they will tell the others. They will not come back.
I will sleep.”</p>

<p>“Go to it, my boy,” said Dorn. “You’ve earned
it, if ever anyone did. I don’t know what we’d
have done without you.”</p>

<p>“Our name would have been Dennis,” declared
Gillis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“I thought your name was Gillis,” said Bomba
wonderingly.</p>

<p>“It is,” was the laughing reply. “I keep forgetting
that you don’t know our slang. I mean
our name would have been mud—there I go again.
What I mean to say is that we would have been
killed if you had not been here.”</p>

<p>Bomba made up his mind that he would remember
these new words so that he could talk like the
white men. He already had a precious collection,
“goat,” “mud,” “Dennis,” “shindig.” And there
had been others, too, that he would try to recall.
He would tell them to Casson and show him how
much he had learned. But just now he was very
sleepy.</p>

<p>“I’ll get you some blankets to lie on,” said
Gillis.</p>

<p>“No,” said Bomba, “I will sleep this way.”</p>

<p>He threw himself down on the ground near the
fire, and in a moment was fast asleep.</p>

<p>But there was no sleep just then for Gillis or
Dorn. They were too wrought up by the dreadful
experiences through which they had gone to
close their eyes. So they sat with their rifles
on their knees until the first faint tinge of dawn
showed in the east. Then they knew that the
danger was past, for that night at least, and after
summoning a couple of natives and placing them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
on watch, they threw themselves wearily on their
blankets in a sleep of utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>Bomba was the first to awake, and for a moment
found it hard to realize where he was. He
sat up, looked around, and caught sight of the
bodies of the jaguars. Then all the events of the
stirring night came back to him.</p>

<p>He had borne himself well in circumstances that
might have made grown men quail. He had met
death face to face, and it had been a matter of
touch and go whether he would escape unscathed.
But the fortune that favors the brave had been
with him, and he had not a scratch. He had
trapped the cooanaradi. He had slain one jaguar
and foiled the others. It was natural that he
should be filled with a feeling of exultation.</p>

<p>But far above the satisfaction at his own safety
was that which came from the thought that he
had saved the white men. Without him, they
would surely have been doomed! He had established
his right to be regarded as a brother. He
had vindicated his white skin.</p>

<p>In twenty-four hours he had gone far. A new
world had opened before him. He had crossed
a chasm that separated him from his own race.
He had realized some of the dreams, answered
some of the questions, solved some of the
mysteries that for a long time past had been
tormenting him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>But he realized that he still had far to go.
How much these white men knew! In what a
different world they moved! How far superior
they seemed to him! How ignorant he was,
compared to them!</p>

<p>But he would learn. He would ask Casson.
Casson must know all the things the other white
men knew. And then his heart sank, as he realized
that Casson seemed to have forgotten all or
almost all that he had ever known. There was
little help to be expected from the man with whom
Bomba lived.</p>

<p>He was engrossed in these meditations when
Gillis opened his eyes. They fell on Bomba, and
recollection came into them.</p>

<p>“How does our hero feel this morning?” asked
Gillis, with a genial smile.</p>

<p>“What is a hero?” asked Bomba, with his usual
directness.</p>

<p>“Why, you fill the bill as well as anyone I ever
saw,” returned Gillis. “A hero is a man or boy
who isn’t afraid.”</p>

<p>“But I was afraid last night,” said Bomba.</p>

<p>“I guess we all were,” remarked Gillis. “Well
then, a hero is one who, even if he is afraid,
doesn’t let fear get the best of him, but fights
on and makes up his mind to keep on fighting till
he dies. And that’s what you’d have done last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
night if it had come to that. But it’s getting
pretty late, and we’ll have to get a move on.”</p>

<p>He shook Dorn awake, gave some orders to
the natives, and soon the camp was alive with
preparations for breakfast.</p>

<p>This time Bomba took his knife and fork at the
outset, and was gratified to note that he could
already handle them much better than he had on
the night before.</p>

<p>“Well, now, my boy,” said Gillis, after they
had enjoyed a hearty meal, “we’ll have to be packing
and getting on our way. As we told you last
night, we’d like nothing better than to have you go
along with us. Still think you can’t, eh?”</p>

<p>“I should like to go,” replied Bomba, and the
look in his eyes was much more eloquent than
words. “But Casson is old and sick. He has
been good to me. I have to get his food for him.
He would die if I should go.”</p>

<p>“That settles it then, of course,” said Gillis
regretfully. “But don’t you think, my boy, that
we’re going to forget you. We owe you too much
for that. Either we’ll come back, or we’ll send
someone else to get you and Casson out of this
jungle and bring you where you belong. In the
meantime, we want to do something to show you
how grateful we are. You saved our lives, and
we want to do something for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>“You do not have to give me anything,” said
Bomba, simply. “I was glad to help you.”</p>

<p>“All the same, you’ll have to take something,”
put in Dorn. “The question is, what shall it be?
The boy can get all the food he wants, and I don’t
suppose he has any use for money.”</p>

<p>“What is money?” asked Bomba.</p>

<p>The men laughed.</p>

<p>“About the most important thing in the world
outside this jungle,” said Gillis. “This is money,”
and he took a gold piece from his pouch and spun
it on the rude board that served as a table.</p>

<p>“It is pretty,” said Bomba.</p>

<p>“A good many people think so,” remarked
Gillis, dryly. “Some would sell their soul for it.”</p>

<p>“What is a soul?” asked Bomba.</p>

<p>“You’re getting in deep, Gillis,” laughed Dorn.</p>

<p>“I sure am with this animated interrogation
mark,” returned his comrade. “The soul is the
best part of us, the part that makes men good
and wise and brave, that makes them different
from the animals.”</p>

<p>“Have I got a soul then?” asked Bomba.</p>

<p>“You sure have,” replied Gillis. “And one of
the best, if you ask me. But we’re getting off the
subject. We want to give you something that
you would like to have. I wonder what it would
be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>His eyes roved about and caught sight of a
harmonica that lay in one of the packs they had
brought along for trading with the natives.</p>

<p>“How would you like this?” he asked of Bomba,
as he picked it up and handed it to him.</p>

<p>Bomba examined it curiously. He liked its
smoothness and its glitter.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Let me show you,” said Gillis, as he took it
from him, put it to his mouth, and played a few
bars of a popular air.</p>

<p>Bomba was amazed and delighted.</p>

<p>“It is like a bird!” he exclaimed. “It sings!”</p>

<p>“Try it yourself,” said Gillis, handing it over.
“Blow your breath into it and draw your breath
back.”</p>

<p>Bomba did so, and although the notes he
brought from it were meaningless and discordant,
they thrilled him with rapture. He could make
music like the white men.</p>

<p>“Keep it,” said Gillis, highly pleased at the lad’s
delight. “It’s yours.”</p>

<p>“It is good to give me this,” said Bomba gratefully,
as he fondled his treasure. It was the first
present he had ever had in his life.</p>

<p>“We’d feel cheap enough if we let it go at
that,” said Dorn. “How about giving the boy a
revolver? You saw how curious he was about
firearms.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“Right enough,” assented Gillis, as he went
into the tent and returned with a shining new
five-chambered revolver. “Here, Bomba, you
liked the big iron stick. This is a little iron stick,
but it does very much the same thing as the big
one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you going to give me that?” exclaimed
Bomba, scarcely able to believe his eyes.</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” said Gillis. “Here, let me show
you how it works.”</p>

<p>He broke the revolver, and Bomba gave a gasp
of dismay.</p>

<p>“You broke it!” he exclaimed in grief.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Gillis. “I have to do
that to load it. See, this is the way it is done.”</p>

<p>He put cartridges in the five chambers, while
Bomba watched him breathlessly. Then he
snapped the stock back and looked around for a
mark.</p>

<p>One of the dead jaguars caught his eye, and
he emptied the revolver into the carcass, firing so
rapidly that it seemed almost one continuous
explosion.</p>

<p>“Now go take a look at the jaguar,” said Gillis.
“You’ll find five holes that weren’t in it before.”</p>

<p>Bomba confirmed this with his eyes. It still
seemed to him like magic, and there was awe
mingled with delight in his ownership of the
weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“Let me put five more holes in the jaguar,” he
begged.</p>

<p>Gillis loaded it for him and gave him directions
how to hold, aim, and fire the weapon, though he
and Dorn took care to take their stand behind
him.</p>

<p>In the tyro’s hands only one more perforation
marked the jaguar’s hide, the rest missing the
mark through Bomba’s unfamiliarity with the
weapon and his failure to allow for its kick.</p>

<p>“All right for a beginner,” commented Gillis.
“With your natural keenness of eye you’ll be a
crack shot as soon as you get used to the gun and
have a little more practice. I only wish we had
more time to teach you. But Casson will give you
lessons, and in a little while you can shoot as
straight with this as you can with your bow.”</p>

<p>Many boxes of cartridges accompanied the gift,
and Bomba tucked them away carefully in his
pouch, feeling as rich as Croesus. It had certainly
been a lucky day for him when he had come
across the white men!</p>

<p>But his delight in his treasure was dimmed
when, a little while later, all preparations were
completed and the party got ready to move.</p>

<p>The rubber hunters themselves, steeled adventurers
as they were, were deeply stirred as they
shook hands with Bomba and bade him good-bye.
They had become strongly attached to this lad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
who had come upon them so strangely, and to
whom, no doubt, they owed their lives. There
was tragic pathos in his loneliness in these vast
wilds with only a half-demented old man to bear
him company.</p>

<p>“You’ll hear from us again, remember that,”
promised Gillis. “We’re not going to let this
thing drop. We will come back or send back for
you.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Bomba. “If you do not come,
my name will be mud.”</p>

<p>The men could not help smiling, and Bomba was
proud. He was showing them that he could talk
like the white men.</p>

<p>They waved a final farewell and took up their
journey through the jungle. Bomba watched them
until the underbrush hid them from view.</p>

<p>The world suddenly became very empty. His
eyes were filled with tears.</p>

<p>He stood there for a long time, trying to still
the ache in his heart. Then he turned his face
toward the south. He must get back to Casson.</p>

<p>Dear old Casson! Kind old Casson! His
heart thrilled with affection. He, at least, was
left to him.</p>

<p>It was not the first time that Bomba had been
away over night from the hut that sheltered him
and the old naturalist. He was the provider of
food, and his hunting trips had often carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
him far afield. But he was always uneasy when
that occurred and anxious to get back as soon as
possible, for Casson was in no condition to be left
alone any more than was necessary.</p>

<p>Having made sure that the revolver, the harmonica,
and the matches were safely bestowed in
his pouch, Bomba started on his homeward
journey.</p>

<p>Refreshed by his night’s sleep and good breakfast,
he made good progress for the first two
hours. Then his exertions began to tell and his
pace slackened, though he was still making remarkably
good time, considering that for part of
the way he had to hack a path through the underbrush
with his machete.</p>

<p>On his way he passed the place of his encounter
with the cooanaradi. Only the skeleton of the
snake remained. And from the cleanness with
which the frame had been stripped, Bomba conjectured
that the ants had been at work.</p>

<p>Some distance further on, he came upon the
ashes of a fire. Some of the embers were still
smouldering and scraps of meat lay scattered
about. Some natives out on a hunt had evidently
stopped there for a meal.</p>

<p>This was a common enough occurrence and gave
the lad no special concern. The Indians of the
vicinity, though not especially friendly, were not
hostile. They were uneasy at the presence of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
whites, whom they looked upon as intruders, but
up to the present they had been content to leave
them alone, and Casson and Bomba on their part
had held aloof from the natives as much as
possible.</p>

<p>So Bomba was not alarmed when he caught
sight of an Indian a little to one side but moving
along on a forest trail that crossed the one that
he was pursuing. They reached the junction of
the trails at about the same time. The Indian
turned and looked at the lad.</p>

<p>Bomba’s heart gave a sudden leap. He saw
a symbol painted in ochre on the Indian’s chest.
It was the symbol of the head-hunters, the ferocious
tribe from the Giant Cataract!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="fs80">IN THE PUMA’S DEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bomba had never before come face to face with
a member of the tribe of head-hunters. Only at
rare intervals had any of these men of evil omen
invaded that section of the jungle where he and
Casson lived.</p>

<p>But when they had come they had left behind
them a wake of death and destruction. They were
cruel and ruthless. They sought for heads as the
North American Indians used to seek for scalps
with which to adorn their wigwams and testify to
their valor.</p>

<p>One of these dreadful trophies hung at the
belt of the Indian who now stood regarding
Bomba with a scowl that sent a chill to the boy’s
heart.</p>

<p>But Bomba let no sign of apprehension show
itself on his face, which had been schooled to repression
and self-control by his jungle experiences.</p>

<p>On the contrary he smiled amicably and put up
his hands, palms outward, as a sign of peace and
good will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“Good hunting, brother?” he asked, in the
language that with certain variations was common
to all the tribes of the region and with which he
was perfectly familiar.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” the Indian grunted noncommittally, as
he scanned Bomba with glowering eyes that had in
them nothing of friendliness. “You white boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Bomba.</p>

<p>“You live with white man that has long hair
and walks with a stick?” pursued the Indian.</p>

<p>Bomba nodded.</p>

<p>“The white man bad medicine,” said the Indian,
his scowl deepening and his hand tightening on his
spear.</p>

<p>“He is good medicine,” declared Bomba.</p>

<p>“He is a Man of Evil,” was the reply. “He
bring trouble on my people. Much sickness.
Many die. Chief Nascanora very angry. He
make talk with big medicine man, and medicine
man say there will always be sickness as long as
white man stay alive.”</p>

<p>A thrill of apprehension ran through Bomba.</p>

<p>“Old white man is good man,” he protested
energetically. “He hurts nobody. He would
like to cure people, not make them sick. He has
been here many years. He is a brother. He has
a good heart.”</p>

<p>“He is a Man of Evil,” repeated the other
doggedly. “Medicine man say so. Medicine man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
know. Tribe will have trouble, much trouble,
unless old white man die.”</p>

<p>Bomba tried to collect his thoughts, which had
been thrown into a tumult by these ominous words.
It came to him that perhaps this man was an
emissary of death chosen by the tribe to accomplish
its purpose. If this were so, Bomba, boy
though he was, would have been ready to do
battle with him for the life of Casson.</p>

<p>But if the man were not alone, if companions
were near at hand, that would put another aspect
on the matter. Then craft and strategy would
have to make up for the disparity of numbers.</p>

<p>“My brother has come a long way,” Bomba
said, changing the subject. “The home of his
people is near the Giant Cataract. Why has my
brother come so far from his own people to do
his hunting alone?”</p>

<p>“I am not alone,” was the answer. “Many of
my people are near me. If I call, they will come.”</p>

<p>Bomba had learned what he wanted to know.
This was but a straying member of a large party.
The news was not reassuring, but it showed him
where he stood. At all costs he must avoid a
combat at this moment.</p>

<p>His revolver, fully loaded, was at his belt and,
despite his unfamiliarity with the weapon, he
could not have missed at such close range. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
the report would have summoned the man’s companions,
who were probably not far away.</p>

<p>So he restrained his impulse to draw it, and
without any betrayal of fear smiled into the man’s
face, waved his hand carelessly in farewell, and
passed on. In a moment the jungle had swallowed
him up.</p>

<p>The Indian had made an instinctive movement
with his spear, and then checked himself and
stood undecided. The dauntless bearing of the
boy disconcerted him.</p>

<p>Bomba, the instant he felt sure that his movements
were hidden from the native, dropped his
careless attitude and made his way with all the
haste of which he was capable through the jungle.
He must reach their hut as soon as possible and
warn Casson—poor, helpless, old Casson—who
would be an easy prey if the enemy came upon
him unawares.</p>

<p>He had not gone far before he heard a loud
shout behind him. This was followed a moment
later by answering shouts from many directions.</p>

<p>He knew at once what they meant. The Indian
had summoned those of his companions who happened
to be within earshot. There would be a
hurried gathering, a hubbub of exclamations, and
then, like a pack of wild animals, they would be
upon his trail.</p>

<p>Bomba was as lithe and strong as a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
panther, and if the going had been reasonably
clear, he could probably have distanced the head-hunters.
But he had the disadvantage of having
to make a path in many places as he went along.
He had to hack his way often through tangled
thickets, and this took up precious time. His
enemies, on the contrary, could follow without
stopping the very path that he had made with
infinite labor. It was one of the ironies of his
situation that he was making the way easier for
his pursuers. He was actually helping them to
overtake him.</p>

<p>Under such conditions, it was only a matter
of time before they would catch up with him.
Already he could tell by the crashing of the
underbrush that they were nearer.</p>

<p>But he kept on, spurred by desperation. His
lungs were laboring, his breath coming in shorter
and ever shorter gasps. He was reaching the
limit of his endurance. The end could not be
long delayed.</p>

<p>As his eyes roved frantically from right to left,
he caught sight of an opening in the side of a
small knoll a little way off from the direction in
which he was headed.</p>

<p>His pursuers were close behind him now. At
any moment the foremost of them might appear
in sight.</p>

<p>Like a flash, Bomba turned in the direction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
the cave and bolted into it headlong, pitching at
full length on the ground within.</p>

<p>He lay there in the semi-darkness panting
heavily, trying to regain his breath, the little
that he had left having been knocked out of him
by the fall.</p>

<p>He could hear the rush of the pursuers as they
passed by in the direction he had been heading,
and he breathed a sigh of heartfelt relief as he
heard their steps receding in the distance. For
the moment he was saved.</p>

<p>But he knew this was only a reprieve. It would
not be long before his enemies would realize that
they were on a false trail. They would miss the
sound of his steps, the marks of his machete on
the bushes. Then they would retrace their steps
and search every nook or cranny in which he
might be hiding. And they could hardly fail to
discover the cave!</p>

<p>As soon as he could breathe again, he rose to
his feet and reconnoitered the hiding place that
had, temporarily at least, proved his salvation.
What his eyes could not see his touch supplied.</p>

<p>There was no apparent exit from the cave except
the opening through which he had come.
But at the back, partly hidden by a shelf of rock,
was a small crevice only a few inches wide. It
seemed impossible at first that it could permit
the passage of his body. But by placing himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
sidewise and drawing in his breath he finally
managed to worm his way through and found
footing on the other side.</p>

<p>Now he could breathe more freely. He could
crouch down in the narrow passage behind the
crevice and be concealed from the sight of anyone
at the entrance of the cave. To a casual observer
the cave would seem empty.</p>

<p>And even if a careful search were made and his
hiding place discovered, he would be in a natural
fortress. No arrow or spear could reach him.
An Indian would be too big to wriggle through
that crevice, and if he tried to do so, he would
be at the mercy of the lad’s knife or pistol while
he was making the attempt.</p>

<p>The first glow of exultation had barely subsided
when Bomba could tell by the sounds outside that
his enemies were returning. He could hear a
babble of voices and grunts of rage and disappointment
at the escape of their prey.</p>

<p>He crouched low behind his barricade, scarcely
daring to breathe.</p>

<p>The steps came nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there was a guttural exclamation
of surprise mingled with triumph, and he knew
that they had discovered the entrance to his
hiding place.</p>

<p>The shout was followed by dead silence, which
Bomba was at no loss to interpret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>His enemies knew that if he were there he
would be desperate, fighting with his back against
the wall. None of them was eager to be the
first to enter and face him. There was no need
for impetuous action. If he were there, he could
not escape.</p>

<p>So they were drawing stealthily nearer, probably
from the side, so as to escape a possible
whizzing arrow, the only weapon with which they
thought he would be equipped.</p>

<p>For some minutes the deathlike silence continued.
Bomba could feel, though he could not
see, that fierce, keen eyes were peering in, trying
to pierce the darkness that at the back of the
cave was almost absolute.</p>

<p>Then came a hissing sound, and a flaming
torch was thrown into the cave, its flaring light
illuminating every crevice of the interior.</p>

<p>Apparently it was empty. If the fugitive had
entered there, it seemed evident that he must
have escaped by some other exit.</p>

<p>To discover that other exit, if there were one,
several of the Indians crowded into the cave, and
one of them picked up the torch to make a more
thorough search.</p>

<p>He had scarcely done so before a terrific hubbub
arose from his companions on the outside of
the cave. Something had frightened them.</p>

<p>The men within rushed out, and there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
snapping and crashing as the whole party forced
its way through the underbrush, evidently in
panic flight.</p>

<p>What had happened? Bomba asked himself.
Was one terror to be succeeded by another?</p>

<p>He listened with all his ears. There was no
sound except that caused by the stampede of the
Indians, now steadily growing fainter.</p>

<p>Minutes passed and still no sound. The strain
became unendurable.</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly, Bomba raised his head and
peered over his barricade.</p>

<p>All he saw was a shadow.</p>

<p>But that was enough to chill his blood.</p>

<p>For the shadow that lay on the ground before
the cave was that of a giant puma, one of the
fiercest inhabitants of the Amazonian wilds!</p>

<p>The owner of the cave had returned!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="fs80">A SIEGE OF TERROR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For a few moments Bomba’s heart seemed to
cease beating.</p>

<p>Down he went again behind his barrier, while
he tried to collect his thoughts in the presence of
this new peril.</p>

<p>The thought that this might be the den of a
wild beast had occurred to him when he first saw
the mouth of the cave, but it had been crowded
out by his desperate need of escaping from his
human enemies.</p>

<p>Now he realized that he was trapped. There
was not one chance in a hundred that the beast
would stay outside for long. Sooner or later it
would enter the cave to rest in readiness for its
nocturnal hunting. And when it did come in,
discovery would be certain.</p>

<p>In Bomba’s crouching position the animal could
not see him. But it would smell him and follow
the scent to the crevice in the rock.</p>

<p>To be sure, it could not get at him. Its huge
body could not squeeze through the narrow opening.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
But when it once became convinced of this
it would settle down to a long siege that would
doom its captive to certain starvation.</p>

<p>Once more Bomba ventured a peep at the
shadow. It had changed its shape. At first the
beast had been standing. Now the shadow
showed that it was stretched out on the ground,
but with its head uplifted, watching perhaps for
the possible return of the Indians that its coming
had frightened off.</p>

<p>That shadow had a dreadful fascination for
Bomba. He watched it as though under a spell,
waiting for the moment when it would change in
shape, when the great tawny beast would rise,
shake itself, yawn, and at last enter the cave.</p>

<p>In the position in which Bomba found himself,
he could use what weapons he had only with great
difficulty. The passage was so narrow that he
had no room to draw his bow. That rendered
his arrows useless.</p>

<p>And the crevice was so located with reference
to his body that he could only use his knife or
revolver with his left hand.</p>

<p>As to hurling his knife, as he had in the case
of the jaguar, he could not draw his arm back
to get sufficient force for the throw. And he was
so little used to the revolver, even with his right
hand, that the chance of his being able to aim
accurately with the left was almost negligible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>His heart sank as he realized his helplessness.
He seemed doomed to die like a rat in a trap.</p>

<p>While he was bitterly pondering his situation,
the shadow moved. Like a shot Bomba’s face
disappeared from the crevice through which he
had been peering, and he crouched down low,
fearful lest the beast should even hear the sound
of his heart thumping against his ribs.</p>

<p>He could hear the padding feet of the puma
as it leisurely entered the cave. Then there came
a sudden pause, a sniff, an ominous growl.</p>

<p>The beast had scented the proximity of a human
being. Bomba knew that its hair was bristling,
its eyes glowing, as they roamed about seeking
to discover the whereabouts of the intruder.</p>

<p>Then the padding was resumed, and the steps
drew nearer his hiding place.</p>

<p>There was a thunderous roar and the beast
dashed violently against the wall, as though it
would batter it down by the sheer force of its
impact.</p>

<p>Three times this was repeated. Then, as
though recognizing the futility of this form of
attack, the animal desisted. The roars were replaced
with snarls, as the puma tried to force its
body through the narrow opening.</p>

<p>It struggled viciously to get through, but its
huge bulk prevented. Foiled in this, it reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
one of its great paws through the opening and
swung it about, trying to get a grip with its claws
on whatever was in that passage and drag it out
within reach of its jaws.</p>

<p>Bomba shrank as far away as possible, being
just able to escape the sweep of the powerful claw
that would have torn into ribbons whatever it
clutched.</p>

<p>Again and again the baffled beast sought to
reach its prey, but without success.</p>

<p>At last it desisted and paced the floor of the
cave with growls and roars that in that narrow
space were almost deafening. Then it settled
down to a siege. Its instinct told it that sooner
or later the trapped enemy must die of starvation,
or come out to meet a fate quicker but more
terrible.</p>

<p>Bomba felt sick and weak under the strain. He
had escaped that terrible paw only by inches.</p>

<p>His only chance seemed to be that the beast at
last might sleep. Then Bomba might creep
through the narrow opening and either steal from
the cave or at least have elbow room to battle
for his life with knife and revolver.</p>

<p>But he dismissed this forlorn hope even as it
came to him. If the beast should doze, it would
be so lightly that even the slightest sound, the
fall of a leaf, would awaken him. He would be
on Bomba before the latter had squeezed through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
the opening. There was no hope from that
quarter.</p>

<p>And with dread for his own safety was mingled
the agonizing thought of what might happen to
Casson, unwarned and helpless before the storm
that was brewing. Even at this moment the head-hunters
might be on their way to the lonely cabin.</p>

<p>An hour passed by. The snarls had ceased, but
Bomba could hear the stertorous breathing that
told him the beast was still there, watchful and
relentless as fate.</p>

<p>At last he ventured a look. With infinite
caution he applied his eye to the crevice in the
wall. There lay the beast, a monster of its kind,
its unblinking eyes turned in his direction.</p>

<p>But those fierce eyes had no terrors for Bomba!</p>

<p>Astonishment, relief, delight chased themselves
over the lad’s features.</p>

<p>His mouth opened and a low crooning sound
issued from his lips, rising and falling in a weird
jungle melody.</p>

<p>The effect on the puma was magical. It started
to its feet. The fierce light faded from its eyes,
and was replaced with a look of pleasure and
benevolence. Then it commenced to purr.</p>

<p>“Polulu!” murmured Bomba. “Polulu! It is
Bomba speaking—Bomba, your friend.”</p>

<p>The purring grew louder, and the great beast
came and rubbed itself against the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Bomba hesitated no longer. He forced his
body through the crevice without the slightest
trepidation, though with some difficulty, for already
the puma was rubbing his head against him,
fawning upon him like a cat, and trying to lick
his hand.</p>

<p>“Polulu. Polulu,” murmured Bomba, as he
caressed the great head fondly. “Why did I not
know it was you? I would not have hidden from
you. You have given Bomba a great fright.”</p>

<p>Polulu purred still more loudly and rubbed his
head so hard against Bomba as to almost knock
him over. Then the beast lay down and rolled
over and over to testify his joy at the meeting.</p>

<p>For the last two years a warm affection had
existed between the two. It had taken birth at
the time the big puma had been caught by a falling
tree that had imprisoned and broken one of its
hind legs.</p>

<p>Bomba had come upon the tortured animal at
a time when it was suffering terribly and biting
savagely at the injured leg. The boy was stirred
with compassion. He had a strange power over
animals, and the puma had sensed his sympathy.</p>

<p>Bomba had brought the animal food and water.
Then he had set to work to free the trapped leg.
This accomplished, he had set and bound up the
injured member, the puma submitting to the treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
because it knew instinctively the kindness
that prompted it.</p>

<p>Many days had passed before it was able to
stand and get about, and during all this time
Bomba had supplied its needs and nursed it back
to health. By the time this was accomplished, the
puma had all the affection for Bomba that a pet
cat has for its master.</p>

<p>Repeatedly since then the paths of the two had
crossed in the jungle, each time to the joy of
both. At times, Polulu had been accompanied by
its savage mates that would have attacked the
boy had not Polulu taken him under his guard
and warned the others that the boy must be immune.</p>

<p>For some minutes Bomba fondled and caressed
the great beast, which responded with equal affection
and manifestations of delight.</p>

<p>Then the pressing need for haste forced itself
on the boy, and with a parting pat on the tawny
head he rose and issued from the cave.</p>

<p>Polulu was disappointed at the briefness of the
lad’s stay, and made as though he would go with
him. But Bomba gently waved him back and the
puma obeyed meekly. And in the lambent yellow
eyes that stared after him Bomba could read regret
and desolation.</p>

<p>Immeasurably relieved in mind as the boy was
at his unexpected escape at the moment that death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
had seemed to be closing in on him, he was tormented
by the thought of the precious time that
had been lost by his enforced stay in the cave.
Now he must redouble his speed, at the same time
keeping a sharp lookout for the marauding
Indians.</p>

<p>He came to the banks of a wide stream that
wound in a sweeping curve through the jungle. To
swim across it would save him a long detour on
land and at least an hour of time.</p>

<p>Ordinarily he would have taken the land route,
with whose dangers he was more familiar and
better able to cope. He had a deep fear of the
caymans, the great South American alligators,
that infested many of the streams.</p>

<p>He could swim like a fish. But the alligators
could also make amazing speed, considering their
clumsiness. And in the water the only weapon
the boy could use effectively would be his knife,
and that would be but of slender use against such
a formidable foe.</p>

<p>He knew, however, that at this time in the day
the alligators would be apt to be sunning themselves
on some of the islands that studded the
stream at intervals. One of these islands he
could see at a little distance, with dark forms like
so many logs fast asleep on the sands.</p>

<p>His resolve was made on the instant. He would
take the chance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>Silently as a shadow he slipped into the water,
and, swimming so smoothly that he scarcely left
a ripple behind him, he moved toward the point
he had in view.</p>

<p>He had traversed more than half the distance
and was already beginning to congratulate himself
on the successful outcome of his venture when
he heard a splash behind him.</p>

<p>Something had broken the surface of the water.</p>

<p>He looked behind him and his heart skipped a
beat.</p>

<p>He saw the dripping head and great open jaws
of a huge cayman coming toward him!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="fs80">THE JAWS OF DEATH</span></h2>
</div>

<p>At sight of the cayman, Bomba, for one
awful instant, felt as though he were paralyzed.
Strength seemed suddenly to have left his arms
and legs.</p>

<p>But only for a moment. The next instant the
instinct of self-preservation asserted itself, and he
shot forward like an arrow.</p>

<p>He knew he could not reach the shore before
the dreadful thing would be upon him. But he
would struggle till the last. As a final resource
he had his knife.</p>

<p>But what would that knife avail against murderous
jaws armed with a score of knives? One
nip from those jaws could sever his leg from his
body, or, if they caught him at the waist, could
bite him in half.</p>

<p>His arms and legs were working like piston-rods.
He was fairly leaping through the water.
But behind him was coming a fearsome thing that
could swim still faster.</p>

<p>Still Bomba sped on, his eyes fixed on the land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
steadily drawing nearer, even though the lad had
the conviction that his feet would never press that
land again.</p>

<p>The muscles in his strong arms were strained
until it seemed as though they would burst. He
breathed with difficulty. His head, surcharged
with blood, felt as though it were encircled by an
iron band that was eating its way into it.</p>

<p>One hurried glance over his shoulder showed
him that the cayman was gaining. The distance
between them had sensibly diminished.</p>

<p>As a whole world of thoughts is said to pass
through the brain of a drowning man, so Bomba
reviewed in those terrible moments the things that
had come into his life.</p>

<p>One thought tore a sob from his aching throat.
It was of Casson, poor, gentle, bewildered Casson,
left alone to face the perils of the jungle, the
jaguar, the sucurujus, the dreaded boa constrictor,
and those human foes, perhaps more terrible still,
bent on his destruction.</p>

<p>There was another grief, a longing bitterly
poignant though but vaguely understood, that
stirred his soul to the depths with agony.</p>

<p>The white men! He would never know now
about that mysterious world from which they had
come, to which at this moment they were returning.
He would not know. He would not know!</p>

<p>The words beat themselves over and over in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
his brain, while his straining muscles labored to
snatch a few more moments from eternity.</p>

<p>He cast one more look behind him. The hideous
brute was nearer now, the fangs in its frightful
jaws gleaming as the cayman clove the water.</p>

<p>Now it was close upon him! Bomba’s legs were
instinctively drawn up to his body to escape the
slash of those dreadful jaws. His hand reached
for his knife.</p>

<p>What was that his dimming eyes saw directly
ahead of him? Bomba’s heart leaped with renewed
hope as he saw that the flat object floating
almost within his reach was a rude raft—four
hollow logs strapped together with bush cord.
The work of caboclos, probably, who had later
discarded it for a more convenient mode of river
travel—the regatao or river canoe.</p>

<p>Could he reach it? The splashing of the alligator
was close behind him. The brute was preparing
for its spring. Every moment Bomba
expected to feel the clamp of those iron jaws, to
be dragged beneath the swirling surface to the
slime and ooze of the river bed, to be feasted on
at leisure.</p>

<p>The boy summoned all his expiring strength in
one last effort. A mighty spurt carried him a
few feet ahead. He must get hold of that raft.
It spelled safety, deliverance from a horrible
fate. Extinction threatened him, and like any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
other creature of the wild he fought madly for his
life.</p>

<p>Another moment and those hungry jaws would
fasten on him, tear his straining soul from his
mangled body.</p>

<p>Now the raft was only an inch from his frantic
fingers—half an inch! He touched it! He
grasped it, lifted himself, slipped back, made one
last effort, pulled himself out and sprawled at full
length upon the raft!</p>

<p>He was not a second too soon. Even as he fell
prone, two vicious jaws snapped savagely. The
cayman lurched against the raft, tipping it to
such an angle that Bomba was almost thrown into
the water.</p>

<p>But the boy held on desperately, and the raft
righted itself.</p>

<p>Again the brute returned to the attack. This
time it flung its body half upon the raft and its
jaws snapped within an inch of the lad’s legs.</p>

<p>There was a heavy paddle lying on the raft.
Bomba snatched it up and brought it down with
all his force on the cayman’s snout.</p>

<p>The brute winced, but still continued its efforts
to climb up on the frail structure. Then
Bomba jammed the stick through the gaping jaws
deep into the brute’s throat.</p>

<p>There was a grunt of pain and rage, and the
cayman fell back into the water that was speedily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
dyed with the blood that came from the wound.
There was no more fight left in the creature. It
swam around for a moment, glaring with its
malignant eyes at the human banquet it had
counted on, and then sank slowly from sight.</p>

<p>Bomba had won. But it had been a terrific experience.
He sat down on the raft, too utterly
worn out for the moment to move a finger.</p>

<p>But if his body was exhausted, his mind was
still active. The same subjects that had tormented
him a few minutes ago in his dreadful extremity
now appeared in a roseate glow.</p>

<p>The white men! He would see them again. Or
if not Gillis and Dorn, others of their kind. His
kind, too, he thought with a thrill of exultation.</p>

<p>As he lay there, his brown body glistening with
river water might have belonged to any native
Amazonian. His sturdy body and rippling
muscles, too, might have been those of a caboclo,
a native waterman.</p>

<p>But not his eyes. The dreaming look that now
clouded their bright watchfulness was a heritage
of white men—the striving of a soul for ascendency
over mere physical things, the yearning for
something higher than an animal existence.</p>

<p>And he was white! He knew it! And those
men, those beings from another world, had acknowledged
that he was white. They knew. They
must know everything. And he had not had with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
them the alien feeling that had always been his
when he had come in contact with the Indians.
He had felt at home with these white men. He
liked them. They had liked him.</p>

<p>But now they were gone. When would he see
them again?</p>

<p>They had been his friends. They had given
him presents. He touched the gifts with reverent
fingers. But the men had gone. Where? To
some mysterious place utterly beyond his comprehension,
where white men talked and laughed
a great deal and slapped each other on the back.</p>

<p>It must be a friendly country, thought Bomba
wistfully, as he looked about on the stream and
jungle where so few things were friendly. He,
too, would like to talk and laugh a great deal and
slap people—white people—on the back.</p>

<p>He had never talked much. Cody Casson was
reticent. He had never laughed much. Casson
was somber.</p>

<p>He would like to bring about a change in the
quiet little hut, to talk and laugh with Casson.
But if he could not have done that before, how
could he do it now? Casson was no longer wise.
He had forgotten all that could be talked about.
He was like a little child again, to be watched
over and guarded from evil.</p>

<p>The thought of Casson put an end to his musings.
Once more he was Bomba, the jungle-trained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
and bred, with all the wily cunning of the
jungle in his eyes. No longer were those eyes
dreaming, but bright and watchful as had been
those of old Geluk, the puma, whose skin Bomba
now wore as covering.</p>

<p>With the paddle which had done him such good
service in warding off the attack of the alligator
he rapidly propelled the rude raft toward the
jutting point where he intended to make his
landing.</p>

<p>He soon touched and leaped upon the shore.
Before him stretched a ygapo, a huge swamp
many miles in width. This must be crossed before
he could reach the hut. The only alternative was
a roundabout route. But the feeling that Casson
might at any minute be in danger urged the boy
to take the shorter cut.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he hated the swamp. Vaguely
he imagined it peopled with evil spirits. The tall
crabwood trees standing in clusters threw deep
shadows over the blackish-brown water, giving it
an indescribably dreary and sinister appearance.
Here and there, out of the slimy ooze sprang huge
tree ferns. No shrieking of parrots or howling
of monkeys in this cheerless spot. Nothing but
dead leaves and treacherous mud, without the stir
of a leaf or the twitter of a bird to break the
brooding silence. It might have been a lost fragment
flung off from a vanished world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>Bomba made his way rapidly through the
ygapo, heavily oppressed by the premonition that
danger lurked about the hut of Casson. In one
hand he firmly grasped his faithful machete,
while in the other he held the revolver, the cherished
gift of the white man.</p>

<p>His eyes scanned the coverts for the first sign
of danger. There was little peril from wild
beasts, who preferred the dry woodland, but he
knew that reptiles might start from the slime
or drop down upon him from the trees.</p>

<p>He found no use, however, for either weapon
while traversing the swamp. It was not until he
was nearly across the ygapo that an acrid scent
assailed his nostrils.</p>

<p>Fire!</p>

<p>He was not alarmed at first. It was probably
only Casson’s campfire built outside the hut.</p>

<p>But in a moment he knew that the volume of
smoke wafted to him by a vagrant breeze could
come from no ordinary bonfire, and his steps
quickened.</p>

<p>He reached the farther end of the ygapo. He
drew himself up to the higher level, and with
relief felt solid ground beneath his feet once
more.</p>

<p>Bomba plunged onward, the increasing density
of the smoke lending wings to his feet. No
thought of Gillis and Dorn in the jungle lad’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
mind now! Only room there for thought of Cody
Casson! Would he reach the hut and the old
man in time?</p>

<p>It took Bomba only a short time to reach the
trees that fringed the clearing he and Casson had
made.</p>

<p>A glance as he burst into the open told him
that his worst fears were realized.</p>

<p>The hut was in flames!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<span class="fs80">FROM OUT THE FLAMES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In a few bounds Bomba was close beside the
blazing hut.</p>

<p>As he rushed forward he shouted hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Casson! Casson! Where are you?”</p>

<p>A groan was his only answer. But it was
enough, for it told him that his only friend and
comrade was entrapped within. Already he
might have been burned beyond any possibility of
rescue.</p>

<p>Bomba acted quickly. The cloth about his
body had been saturated during his progress
through the swamp. This he tore from him and
swiftly bound it about his nose and mouth. For
this much he knew—that to inhale that writhing,
forked-tongue demon men called fire meant certain
death.</p>

<p>To adjust the cloth took but a few seconds.
Gathering his wiry muscles beneath him, he
sprang for the flame-filled doorway of the hut.</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed to him that the whole
world was an inferno of flame. His flesh was
seared by the terrific heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>Then he was through it! The interior of the
hut was filled with smoke, the heat almost unbearable.
Bomba’s eyes were smarting, blinded.
He could only grope about, stumbling, calling to
Casson in a strange, cracked voice.</p>

<p>He almost gave up hope. He decided that
Casson and he must perish there together. Then
his groping fingers touched something that moved
and groaned.</p>

<p>Could he get Casson outside the hut before the
flimsy walls of it collapsed, burying both of them
in the burning debris?</p>

<p>Even as Bomba asked himself the question, he
gathered the wasted form of Casson in his
strong young arms.</p>

<p>Choking, blinded, staggering, he stumbled
with his burden in the direction he thought the
doorway would be. He came in violent contact
with a wall, and was almost flung down with his
helpless burden.</p>

<p>His lungs fairly begging for a breath of air,
eyes smarting agonizingly with smoke, he regained
his balance and struggled on.</p>

<p>He pressed Casson’s nose and mouth close
against the cloth that covered his own and
groped forward until at last he found the doorway
of the hut. A moment’s pause, a gathering
of forces, then a mad plunge through the devouring
flame into the open air beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>Bomba laid Casson on the ground at a safe
distance from the blazing structure, and with a
swift motion tore the cloth from his own nose
and mouth. This, which had begun to scorch
from the frightful heat, he flung to the ground
and trampled upon with his sandaled feet.</p>

<p>Then he passed a hand over his smarting, tear-filled
eyes, and bent to examine Casson.</p>

<p>The old naturalist was conscious, and looked
up at the boy with a pleading look.</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” he panted, his breath coming
painfully. “Never mind me. Save the hut.”</p>

<p>Weak as he was, he half-raised himself on his
elbow and stared wildly at the hut, the only home
he knew.</p>

<p>Bomba with one hand pushed the old man
back not ungently on the ground.</p>

<p>“Bomba will put out fire,” he said, in the
soothing tones one would use to a frightened
child. “You sit quiet, Casson. Watch.”</p>

<p>Without further delay, Bomba, set to work to
save the threatened habitation that had sheltered
him and his companion for so many years.</p>

<p>Luckily, the bulk of the fire was thus far confined
to one part of the hut. Bomba picked up a
bucket, used by Casson and himself to boil the
game that the boy’s hunting expeditions brought
back to the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>With this he worked like a madman, carrying
water from a stream that ran a few yards in
the rear and dashing it over the untouched portions
of the hut.</p>

<p>When this was thoroughly saturated, he began
work with his machete tearing down one flaming
wall and then beating out the fire with a huge
palm-leaf broom that Casson had used to keep
the interior neat.</p>

<p>It was hard and discouraging work. More
than once Bomba felt that he was fighting a losing
battle. Not only was the hut in danger of being
destroyed, but the jungle to the rear of it was
threatened.</p>

<p>Many of the trees near by were rubber trees,
and this thought helped to spur Bomba to renewed
activity. Those were the kind of trees
that Gillis and Dorn had been seeking—seeking
for the Apex Rubber Corporation, whatever that
might mean.</p>

<p>Bomba had no idea of the millions of rubber
trees there must be in the length and breadth
of the Amazonian jungle. All he knew was that
the white men regarded them as precious. Very
well then, he would guard these from fire until
Gillis and Dorn should come to claim them. It
was good to be able to do something for these
white men who had been so good to him.</p>

<p>So to save the trees as well as his home, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
toiled on with dogged persistence, while Casson
watched him with feverish, half-wild eyes.</p>

<p>It was a long time coming, but victory came at
last. Half of the hut had been torn or burned
away and the last smoldering spark had been
extinguished.</p>

<p>Tired, his brown skin scorched in a dozen
places, the boy flung himself down beside Casson,
panting.</p>

<p>“You see,” he said, his bright eyes full of
triumph, “Bomba did not let the fire touch the
rubber trees.”</p>

<p>Casson looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“Rubber trees?” he repeated vaguely.</p>

<p>“Back there,” said Bomba, with a wave of his
hand. “White men want rubber trees. They
hunt them with the caboclos. I save some for
them.”</p>

<p>There was a boyish elation in his tone that
penetrated even Casson’s bewildered senses. He
put out a wavering hand to Bomba, and for the
first time noticed how badly the boy was burned.</p>

<p>“You will blister,” he said.</p>

<p>Bomba looked down indifferently at his
bronzed skin.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he returned. “You are burned, too.”</p>

<p>Without further speech, he rose silently and
disappeared in the jungle. He reappeared a short
time later, carrying handfuls of the river mud.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
This he smeared thickly over Casson’s hands
and face, tearing open the tattered shirt of the
old naturalist to see if his chest was burned.</p>

<p>Then he vanished again, to return with more
mud which he spread over his own burns. Then
he sat down beside the old man for a few minutes
of well-earned rest.</p>

<p>“The hut is bad,” he said, after a few moments
of contemplation. “It is almost half gone. I will
fix it.”</p>

<p>Cody Casson made no reply.</p>

<p>He was a frail old man, bent with the weight
of what seemed at least seventy years. He had
a finely shaped head and features that must have
once been pleasing, though now deeply seamed
with the wrinkles of exposure and hardship. His
expression was kindly and benignant. His eyes
were blue and had once been clear and penetrating,
though now they had the bewildered vacuous
look that comes to the half demented.</p>

<p>As he sat there now he seemed to be puzzling
over something. Presently he looked up at
Bomba with an expression that the boy knew
well, having seen it there many times before.</p>

<p>The aged man was trying to remember, trying
to recall something concerning past events of his
own life of which Bomba knew nothing.</p>

<p>“You said”—Casson spoke slowly and painfully
as though trying to force his thoughts to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
keep pace with his words—“you said something
about—white men. You mean—what did you
mean?”</p>

<p>A curious shyness fell on Bomba. He could
not tell Cody Casson all that was in his mind
concerning these white men, could not explain to
him the vague but enchanting vistas this chance
meeting with his kind had opened up to him.
How could he explain to another what he could
hardly explain to himself? He was a creature
of the wild, inarticulate, feeling the more deeply
because he had no words adequate to express his
thoughts.</p>

<p>Questioned now by Casson, he could give only
the bare facts concerning his encounter with the
rubber hunters, how he had made his way to them
following the report of the iron stick, how he
had helped them fight off the hungry jaguars, and
how subsequently they had presented him with the
harmonica, the matches, and the revolver.</p>

<p>He exhibited these treasures with great pride,
and even played a few weird and mournful notes
on the harmonica.</p>

<p>“This,” he lifted the revolver carefully in one
brown hand, “they said you would show me how
to use. They told me something about it. It is
like your iron stick. It shoots blue fire and a
thing they call a cartridge. See, they gave me
some of them,” and with face eager and eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
glowing he brought forth the boxes of ammunition.</p>

<p>Casson was staring at the jungle boy in a
queer, half-fascinated way. Bomba was frightened.
He broke off in the midst of what he was
saying and timidly touched the arm of the old
man.</p>

<p>“You are sick?” he asked anxiously. “I will
go to the ygapo and bring back herbs.”</p>

<p>He was half-way to his feet when Casson’s
nervous grip on his arm halted him.</p>

<p>“No, no! I am not sick!” he cried. “You are
a white boy, as white as those men are. You
should not be living here, buried in the jungle.
All right for an old man, all right for—old—Casson.”
The disjointed sentence wavered into
silence.</p>

<p>Bomba regarded the old man eagerly, anxiously.
In his heart a strange excitement was
throbbing. Was the door that at times had been
partly opened to be swung wide at last? Was
he to learn something about—what strange
words had the white men used?—“folks,”
“relations”?</p>

<p>That he was white he had known for a long
time and secretly exulted in it. But what did it
mean to be white?</p>

<p>Primarily he knew that it referred to the color
of the skin. His was different from that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
caboclos that ranged the rivers, different from
that of the Indians who lived in the heart of the
jungle.</p>

<p>But it must mean more than that. To be
white meant not only to look different, but to act
differently, to think differently, to live differently.
What inner thing was it that made those who
wore white skin for a covering, like himself and
Casson and Gillis and Dorn, different from the
brown or copper-skinned natives?</p>

<p>It was a problem too deep for Bomba, a problem
that perplexed while it fascinated. Instinctively
he knew that Cody Casson had the
answer, or at least that he had possessed it in
the days before the explosion of the fire stick.</p>

<p>The boy turned to the naturalist with a movement
animal-like in its swiftness. He wanted to
question him, to find out the truth, but he did
not know how to begin.</p>

<p>But Cody Casson, groping in his mind, spoke
suddenly of his own accord.</p>

<p>“I try to remember,” he muttered while Bomba
bent closer to him, anxious to let not a word
escape. “I try, but something closes like a door
in my mind, locking me out, locking me out——”</p>

<p>It was pitiable to see him trying to goad his
poor twisted brain into action. Bomba sat as
though carved in stone, fearing that any movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
on his part might hinder the revelation that
seemed on the brink of utterance.</p>

<p>Casson began again, the words coming more
quickly and with feverish intensity.</p>

<p>“It is for you I want to remember, Bomba;
for you! I owe it to you. I am trying to think,
trying—the door again—Bomba, help me to push
back the door. There, I almost had it! Bartow—push,
push hard, Bomba—trying to remember—Laura,
dear sweet Laura—Oh, I can’t! I
can’t! The door is shut. Gone—gone——”</p>

<p>The last word was a shriek.</p>

<p>With a groan of despair, Cody Casson turned
over on his face, thin, veined hands outflung to
clutch the jungle growth, his form convulsed with
a passion of sobs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<span class="fs80">THE SHOUT OF WARNING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>This emotional outbreak on the part of Casson
disturbed and puzzled Bomba.</p>

<p>Before it, he remained inarticulate, dumb,
though there stirred in him a great longing to
comfort his companion. The white men, he
thought, would have slapped him on the back and
laughed and made him feel better.</p>

<p>But Bomba could not do this. A strange embarrassment
restrained him. So he sat and looked
at Casson and suffered with him and said nothing.</p>

<p>The storm was short-lived. Casson’s groping
fingers unclenched, and a long sigh shuddered
through his frame.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Bomba gently turned him over,
and, gathering some fallen leaves, placed them
as a cushion beneath Casson’s head.</p>

<p>“You wait and rest here,” he ordered. “I will
go and get some herbs.”</p>

<p>This time Casson made no objection to his
going. He seemed exhausted, apathetic. His
poor bruised mind no longer strove for memory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
It was doubtful that he even knew Bomba had
left him.</p>

<p>The lad returned after a while with a handful
of herbs. Over these he poured some river water
and set the pot upon a small heap made of a few
crossed sticks.</p>

<p>Bomba brought forth the precious supply of
“fire sticks,” as he mentally named the matches
Gillis and Dorn had given him, intending to light
the fire with one of them.</p>

<p>With a feeling of great excitement he struck
one upon a stone near by. This had been, while
in the white men’s camp, an ever recurrent
miracle, the quick spurt of flame that followed the
scratching of this strange little stick along a
rough surface.</p>

<p>But to his astonishment and utter chagrin the
fire stick failed him. There was no response to
his quick stroke upon the rock.</p>

<p>Bomba sat back upon his heels and regarded
the match with frowning attention. Here was
something he could not understand. Under the
direction of the rubber-hunters, he had struck
fire from the stick as easily as they had themselves.
What then was the matter now?</p>

<p>He tried another match and then another, but
when they still failed to give forth their magic
fire, Bomba threw them from him with angry
violence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>With a grunt of disgust he had recourse to his
old standbys of bowl and stick, and soon had
the fire going merrily.</p>

<p>Bomba was disturbed and worried by the incident.
He could not know that the matches
had been ruined for the time during his swim in
the rushing waters of the river. Neither Gillis
nor Dorn had thought to tell him that water was
bad for these queer fire sticks.</p>

<p>So Bomba reasoned that the fault must lie with
him. He must have lost his cunning since he had
left the white man’s camp. In a vague way he
felt that he was sinking back again, back into that
morass of ignorance and loneliness from which
his brief acquaintance with the white men had
inspired him with the wish to raise himself.</p>

<p>Was he white after all, except in the color of
his skin? Had he not lived in the jungle too
long to hope to escape to that other and mysterious
one, so utterly different from the one in
which he had been brought up? He was sure
that Gillis or Dorn could have struck that match.
How far he was below them! Would he ever
be able to stand on a plane with them?</p>

<p>But he dismissed these gloomy forebodings
and turned to the work at hand. The boiling
herbs in the pot sent up a stifling, aromatic odor.
Bomba had learned the secret of herb medicine
from Candido, a poor half-witted caboclo who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
traveled from place to place living on turtles’
eggs and fish and such game as he could manage
to bring down with his arrows.</p>

<p>Candido was the only native who had ever
shown any friendliness toward Bomba. He had
told the boy the secret of the herb medicine, and
had taught him where to search for the spindly
little plant along the river’s edge.</p>

<p>Since then this primitive medicine had served
as Bomba’s stock remedy for all the ills of Casson
and himself. It had remarkable healing and tonic
qualities. Bomba had once taken it internally
for snake bite, and since he had not died, believed
implicitly ever afterward in the panacea of
Candido, the half-witted caboclo.</p>

<p>So now, when it had acquired the proper consistency,
he made a leaf cup and poured some of
the steaming liquid into it. Lifting Casson to a
sitting position, he put the primitive cup to his
lips and commanded that he drink.</p>

<p>“You will feel good,” he declared, and Casson
obediently swallowed the dose.</p>

<p>Casson shortly afterward seemed greatly revived.
He insisted on sitting up, his back
propped against a tree. From this vantage point
he watched Bomba as the boy prepared to clear
away the ruins of the fire.</p>

<p>The jungle boy worked hard and fast. It was
no easy task to clear away the débris, much of it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
still hot and smouldering, and night was coming
on. Later he would rebuild the damaged side
of the hut. For the present it was sufficient that
he arrange some sort of bed for Casson and build
a fire that would keep the prowling beasts of the
forest at a safe distance.</p>

<p>While he worked, Bomba could feel the wistful
eyes of Casson upon him. He knew that the old
naturalist was again groping, trying to swing
open that “closed door” in his mind.</p>

<p>The work was done at last. Leaves and
branches for a bed had been dragged within the
hut. The fire was built far enough from the
cabin not to endanger it, but still close enough
to warn off nocturnal marauders.</p>

<p>Bomba went for water to the stream that
flowed back of the dwelling, and, returning, set
the pot once more upon the fire, this time to prepare
the evening meal.</p>

<p>There was no food about the place, for Bomba
had brought none back from his trip to the white
man’s camp. He was about to go into the forest,
weary as he was, in search of some sort of game,
when Casson’s faint voice called to him.</p>

<p>“There are turtle eggs,” he said. “I found
them this afternoon when I was watching the
ciganas, those big brown birds with the splendid
crowns. They are there, the eggs, beyond that
large flat stone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>He pointed to the cache where he had concealed
the spoils of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Gratefully, Bomba seized upon the eggs and
plunged them into the boiling water. Turtle eggs
were ever a luxury for the jungle-bred palate.</p>

<p>When they were ready, Bomba brought them
to Casson, and the two sat cross-legged upon the
ground to eat the simple repast.</p>

<p>Bomba was tired and ravenous. He consumed
several of the eggs in jungle fashion by clipping
off the tops and then squeezing the shell in both
hands until yolk and white were forced through
the opening. It was some time before his appetite
was sufficiently appeased to permit of
conversation.</p>

<p>Then he said to Casson:</p>

<p>“Why did you stay inside the hut when it was
in flames? If I had not come just when I did,
you would have been burned to death.”</p>

<p>Casson nodded and passed a hand across his
forehead in bewildered fashion.</p>

<p>“That is what puzzles me,” he said. “I had
walked so far through the jungle that I was very
tired, and flung myself down to rest. I must
have fallen asleep, and when I woke the hut was
full of smoke. I guessed what had happened at
once, and tried to rise to make my way from
the place. But there was no strength in me——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“The smoke made you blind?” suggested
Bomba.</p>

<p>“No.” Again that pitiful gesture of bewilderment.
“My brain was clear. I was not dazed,
as though from the smoke. It was weakness. I
could not move. I knew that unless you came
and rescued me, I must lie there and be burned.”</p>

<p>Bomba pondered this, brow furrowed. He was
greatly worried about Casson. The old man
must be weaker than he had thought. Bomba
must take good care of him.</p>

<p>And this led him to speak of the Indians, the
thought of whom had been driven from his mind
by the excitement of the fire.</p>

<p>“It is not safe for you to go far into the jungle,”
he warned the old man. “The head-hunters
have come from the Giant Cataract. They will
kill you if they find you when I am not there.”</p>

<p>Casson shrugged his shoulders. He had long
since ceased to regard his life of great value.</p>

<p>“I am not afraid,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“But I am afraid for you,” said Bomba. “They
have bad hearts. Some in their tribe have been
sick and some have died. They say you do this.
They say if they kill you, their men and women
will not be sick.”</p>

<p>Casson smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“They are foolish men,” he said. “I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
never done harm to anyone. I would rather do
them good if I could.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Bomba. “I said that to one
of them. I told him you were a brother, a good
man. But he would not listen. The medicine man
has said that you must die.”</p>

<p>Still Casson’s interest was only slight.</p>

<p>“They are like children,” he replied. “They
think one thing to-day and another thing to-morrow.
Then, too, they come from far off, and
they do not know this part of the jungle. They
might search for months and not find us.”</p>

<p>Such optimism made Bomba desperate. What
could he do against the listless indifference of one
who cared but little whether he lived or died?</p>

<p>“They do not know where we are,” he admitted;
“but the caboclos who live here know.
They may catch one of them and hurt him and
tell him they will kill him if he does not tell
them where we live. Then he will tell them.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose he does?” sighed Casson
wearily. “And suppose they come? We will do
our best. We can do no more. Maybe we can
talk to them and show them how foolish they
are. If we have to fight, we will do that. If
they kill us we cannot help it.”</p>

<p>But this calm fatalism was by no means to
Bomba’s liking. Life ran strong in his veins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
and he was determined to preserve it as long as
possible.</p>

<p>“Listen,” he said. “I will make this house as
strong as I can. I will pile rocks against the
walls. And there is the boat in the stream behind
the hut. If you hear them coming or see signs of
them in the jungle, get into the boat and row
down the river. They will have no boats. And
the river leaves no tracks. I will learn how to
use the fire stick. It will frighten them, if they
hear it. Maybe they will think that we have
magic and will go away.”</p>

<p>They were but slender props on which the boy
leaned, but his stout heart did not quail at the
odds against him. The life in the jungle—the
jungle itself—was always against him, but his
quick wit and unfailing courage had brought him
through so far, and he dauntlessly faced the
future.</p>

<p>For a long time after this the man and the boy
sat in silence. Casson was wandering in some
vague land of his own. Bomba kept repeating to
himself over and over the words that had fallen
from the old man’s lips, “Bartow” and “Laura.”</p>

<p>What had Casson meant? What had he been
upon the point of telling?</p>

<p>Bomba did not know. But he was sure of one
thing—that he would never forget those two
words. Some day, perhaps, he would find out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
what they meant. But how? Would that closed
door in Casson’s mind open? Would the jungle
boy have to search for the knowledge he craved
in the outside world—the world of the white
men?</p>

<p>Bomba slept fitfully that night. Several times
he was up to replenish the fire. Only toward
morning did he fall into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>He was aroused at last by a cry from Casson—a
cry of fear and horror.</p>

<p>Another shout, this time of warning, from the
old man:</p>

<p>“Bomba!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<span class="fs80">THE VAMPIRES ATTACK</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bomba was awake instantly. He strove to rise,
but fell back heavily. His limbs seemed weighted
with iron.</p>

<p>At the same moment another shrill cry from
Casson reached him!</p>

<p>“Vampires! The blood-sucking vampires!
Quick, Bomba! Quick!”</p>

<p>As Bomba’s eyes accustomed themselves to the
gloom of the hut they caught sight of the horrid
creature that had provoked Casson’s cry of
warning—a blood-sucking vampire bat, as large
as a hawk, with a spread of over two feet across
the wings.</p>

<p>True to its habits, it had attacked its victim
while the latter was sleeping. It had settled on
Bomba’s feet and started to suck his blood, while
its great flapping wings kept up a gentle fanning
motion, designed to soothe the lad and keep him
asleep as long as possible.</p>

<p>Bomba had been so exhausted from his exertions
of the day before that the bat’s task had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
been easy, and it had been able to prey on him for
a long time undisturbed.</p>

<p>In a flash Bomba knew what had happened to
him. This, then, was the reason for that strange
numbed feeling in his legs. Much of his blood
must have passed from him to the vampire to
render him so weak.</p>

<p>The bat was still at his feet, draining him of
the vital fluid, flapping, flapping those terrible
wings with a lulling motion.</p>

<p>A wild fury assailed Bomba, rage at his own
impotence.</p>

<p>With a tremendous effort, he raised himself to
a sitting posture and moved his half-paralyzed
legs.</p>

<p>The vampire left its perch on Bomba’s foot
and flapped into the air a short distance, its
vicious, beady eyes fastened malignantly on the
boy’s face. Bomba knew that the terrible creature,
with the cunning instinct of its kind, was
aware of his weakness, and would not easily be
frightened off.</p>

<p>At the same moment there was another cry
from Casson, and two other sinister shapes
flapped their way into the half-ruined hut.</p>

<p>Bomba gave a hoarse cry, staggered to his feet
and reached for the heavy club that he always
kept close by his side when he slept. With the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
other hand he grasped his machete and turned
grimly to face the invaders.</p>

<p>But even as he turned, he staggered and almost
fell. He was horribly weak. He could hardly
hold the weapons. It was a gigantic effort even
to lift them above his head.</p>

<p>He called to Casson, hoping for some help
from the old man. But the aged naturalist was
sitting upright on his improvised couch of
boughs and palm leaves, and his eyes were fixed
with the bewildered, half-fascinated look of a
frightened child upon the horrible winged
intruders.</p>

<p>Bomba groaned. Lifting the machete with a
tremendous effort—he had already discarded the
club, finding the weight of both weapons too much
for him—he made a feeble advance upon the
enemy.</p>

<p>There was a whirring of wings, and the hideous
creatures swooped down on him in a black, loathsome
cloud.</p>

<p>Bomba gave way before the fury of the onslaught,
striking at them with the machete, while
with the other arm he shielded his face from the
batting of those merciless wings.</p>

<p>Sensing his weakness, the bats became more
bold and vicious. They pressed upon him, striking
him about the head and body. There was
a sharp pain in the arm that shielded his face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
and Bomba felt a trickle of blood run slowly
down to his finger tips.</p>

<p>He lowered the shielding arm and shook the
blood from his fingers. He wielded the machete
again, and this time found a mark. But the blow
was weak, and far from seriously injuring his foe
seemed only to have the effect of further enraging
it.</p>

<p>There was a second fierce attack, and beneath
the flailing of wings Bomba found himself borne
to the floor.</p>

<p>In the fall the machete dropped from his hands.</p>

<p>Weaponless! Helpless!</p>

<p>In a fury of impotence, Bomba beat at the bats
with both fists. He struck out wildly, blindly.
But his wily enemies avoided the blows and
pressed him the more viciously.</p>

<p>Bomba could not see that Casson had slipped
from his bed and was staggering to his feet. Even
if he had, he would have felt but little hope.
Before Casson in his enfeebled state could be of
any assistance, Bomba’s need of help would be
over.</p>

<p>The furious attack of his fists had kept the
enemy at bay for only a few seconds, and now
Bomba was utterly exhausted. His muscles refused
to obey the commands of his will. His
hands fell limp, and again the vampires settled
upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>The arms with which he tried to protect his
face were bitten a score of times. Blood welled
from the wounds. One of the vampires had
settled upon his chest. Its weight seemed to be
crushing Bomba, smothering him. The next
moment he expected it to be at his throat.</p>

<p>With a hoarse cry he threw out one arm. His
fingers touched something cold and hard. The
revolver, the gift of the white men!</p>

<p>What was it that thrilled Bomba as his fingers
closed upon the barrel of the weapon? What
meant the excitement that coursed through his
weakened body as his finger felt the trigger? A
feeling inherited from generations of white ancestors;
the sensation of almost limitless power
that the touch of a firearm brings to its possessor?</p>

<p>With all his remaining strength Bomba called
for Casson to get out of the way.</p>

<p>“Fire stick! Shoot!” he cried, and Casson,
understanding, backed into a far corner of the
hut.</p>

<p>Bomba’s arm was throbbing and paining. He
was bruised and beaten by those powerful wings.
He felt as though almost the last ounce of
strength had been drained from him. That sensation
of overpowering weakness warned him
that he must act quickly if he were to act at all.</p>

<p>Slowly he lifted the revolver and pressed it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
against the body of the bat that rested on his
breast.</p>

<p>The boy shut his eyes, held his breath, and
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>There was a loud report, a curiously throttled
squawk close to his ear, and what had been a
vampire bat was now but a gory mass huddled
on the ground.</p>

<p>The noise of the shot had frightened the other
two marauders, and they hovered about fanning
the air with their great wings, manifestly uncertain
whether to return to the attack or take refuge
in flight.</p>

<p>Relieved of the weight of them, Bomba raised
himself unsteadily on his left elbow and again
lifted the magic gift of the white men.</p>

<p>Despite his fatigue, his weakness from loss of
blood, Bomba was fiercely exultant. He had done
with this wonderful weapon what he had failed
to do with the club and the machete.</p>

<p>But there was small time allowed him for
jubilation. The vampires, the first moment of
panic passed, evidently resolved not to let their
prey escape them and again returned viciously to
the attack.</p>

<p>This time Bomba was ready for them.</p>

<p>Casson, watching from the remote corner of
the hut, saw the boy slowly lift the weapon.
Bomba waited until the first of the assailants was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
almost upon him. He was by no means sure of
his skill with this death-dealing weapon, and he
meant to take no chances of the bullet going wild.</p>

<p>There came a second report, another wild flapping
of wings, and he had lessened the odds
against him by half. But the remaining vampire
kept on straight for Bomba’s head.</p>

<p>Bomba pulled the trigger again, but only an
ominous click answered him. Twice he tried
again desperately, and with the same result.</p>

<p>And now the vampire was fairly upon him.</p>

<p>Acting purely on instinct, Bomba shifted the
revolver in his hand, and with the butt end of it
struck at his enemy. He hit the bat full on its
ugly head, and it fell stunned to the floor.</p>

<p>Bomba did not know whether it was dead or
not. But he meant to make certain, and he
struck at the bat again and again until it was a
mass of pulp.</p>

<p>The battle was over. It had been like a struggle
in a nightmare. In every other fight in which
he had ever engaged he had been in the full possession
of his senses. His courage, his agility,
his strength had been at his command. But in
this fearful combat the loss of blood before he
awoke and the resultant physical weakness had
put him under a terrible handicap.</p>

<p>But the soul of him had not failed. His indomitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
fighting spirit had brought him through
a victor.</p>

<p>He lay there panting, and it was some time
before he could struggle to his feet.</p>

<p>He shoved the carcasses of the vampires from
him with a disgusted grunt. Then he balanced
the revolver in his hand and stared at it with a
strange gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I am like the white men now,” he said to
Casson, as the latter crawled over to him. “I
can use the fire stick!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<span class="fs80">KIKI, WOOWOO AND DOTO</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bomba’s exultation subsided somewhat when
he recalled the fact that the much-prized weapon
had failed to work the last time he had pulled
the trigger.</p>

<p>“It is broken and there are no white men here
to give me another,” he groaned.</p>

<p>Casson took it in his shaking fingers and examined
it. Long years before he had been an
expert shot with both rifle and revolver and was
thoroughly familiar with their mechanisms.</p>

<p>He broke the stock and examined the
chambers.</p>

<p>“This is what is the trouble,” he said, as he
saw that the chambers were empty. “It can’t
shoot if there’s nothing in there to shoot. You
didn’t have it fully loaded.”</p>

<p>“But it was loaded when I left the white man’s
camp!” Bomba replied. Then he remembered
that he had been tempted to try his marksmanship
on a tree the day before and had thus disposed
of three of his cartridges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>His relief was great at this solution of the
mystery, and he reloaded the weapon forthwith,
mentally recording a vow that never again would
he go to sleep or sally forth into the jungle without
the revolver containing the full five missiles,
any one of which might spell the difference between
life and death.</p>

<p>A sudden thought occurred to him as he shoved
the bodies of the vampires out of the door.</p>

<p>“Perhaps one of them had been here before,”
he said to Casson, “and that is what made him
come back with others to-night.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think that?” asked the old
man, looking at him with some surprise.</p>

<p>“Because you were so weak when I found you
in the hut,” replied Bomba. “The bat may have
been sucking your blood when you lay asleep.
Then the fire came and the smoke frightened the
bat away. But he had taken so much of your
blood that you had no strength left to get outside
the door.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that; but it may be so,”
replied Casson. “I know I never felt so weak
before. I felt as if I could not move hand or
foot. And perhaps that is the reason I could not
help you to-night. I wanted to. I tried to. I
would have given my life to get to your side. But
I could not.”</p>

<p>Though he could hardly drag one foot after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
the other, Bomba went to the stream back of the
hut and washed his wounds thoroughly. Then he
got out a salve that had great soothing and curative
qualities and applied it on every place where
he had been bitten. This done, he fell rather than
lay down, and reclined there utterly exhausted till
the break of day.</p>

<p>It was now that his vitality and perfect physical
condition stood him in good stead. Had he
been less hardy he might have succumbed, owing
to his great loss of blood.</p>

<p>Even as it was, it took several days to restore
him to his usual condition. His hunting and fishing
had to be given up for a time, as he did not
dare to venture into the jungle.</p>

<p>As he grew a little stronger, he busied himself
in the rebuilding of the ruined portion of the hut.</p>

<p>The hut, in which they had lived for years, was
simple in the extreme, though compared to some
of the abodes of the half-breeds and the primitive
shelters of the Indians, it was almost palatial.</p>

<p>It had been totally enclosed on all four sides,
except for the small opening of the doorway,
which let in light and air, whereas many of the
huts of the caboclos had only roofs for coverings
and were open on all four sides to the vicious
fury of tropical storms. Those of the natives,
deep in the heart of the jungle, were still more
simple, consisting usually of cotton hammocks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
swung between two trees and a couple of giant
palm leaves meeting above for a covering.</p>

<p>There was a wood flooring, laid by Casson
years ago, that served to keep out scorpions and
the snakes that made their home in the ygapo.
It had contained two hammocks, which had been
destroyed in the fire, some old boxes with markings
on them that had become illegible from time,
a chest in which Casson had stored his precious
specimens of butterflies and flowers, some scientific
books, a few old rusted cooking utensils, and
some bits of nicked and broken crockery.</p>

<p>The dress of the inmates of the hut was as
primitive as their furniture. Casson wore an
old patched pair of trousers and a ragged cotton
shirt, which he washed now and then in the
river at the back. But Bomba, child of the jungle,
preferred the dress of the Indians, the mundiyeh,
or short tunic of native cloth, with the addition
of the puma skin which helped to keep him warm
when he was compelled to sleep out at night.</p>

<p>Bomba worked steadily at the reconstruction
of the hut, which he was determined to make
stronger than it had been before, in order that it
might serve as a fort in case they should be attacked
by the head-hunters. He used timbers of
lignum vitæ, the toughest and strongest wood of
the Amazon jungle. Then he stopped up all the
crevices with mud, that under the fierce sun soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
assumed the consistency of stone. He wound
everything about with stout bush cord, and completed
his work by piling mud and stones against
the lower part of all four walls.</p>

<p>And always while he worked Bomba pondered
the words that had fallen from Casson’s lips
when he had heard of the visit of Bomba to the
camp of the white men.</p>

<p>“Bartow.” “Laura.” He repeated them to
himself perhaps a thousand times. What did
they mean? What bearing, if any, did they have
on his own life and destiny?</p>

<p>Several times he was on the point of asking
Casson for an explanation. But he remembered
the terrible paroxysm into which Casson had been
thrown the last time he had uttered those words.
Bomba was afraid to precipitate another such
scene. It might kill Casson. He loved the old
man, clung to him. He would not endanger his
life by probing him with any further questions.</p>

<p>In a few days the work on the hut was finished.
Bomba was proud of his craftsmanship, and even
Casson roused himself from his apathy far enough
to bestow some words of praise.</p>

<p>But now that his task was done and his strength
fully recovered, a great restlessness took possession
of Bomba. Casson, a mere shadow of a
man, going for hours without speaking a word,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
responding to questions only in monosyllables, was
no companion for the lad.</p>

<p>Bomba longed to be off to the shadowy depths
of the jungle. He had enemies there, but he also
had friends. He would call these friends to him,
Kiki and Woowoo, Doto, the giant monkey, and
Tatuc, head of the monkey tribe.</p>

<p>They were the warmest friends he had in that
vast tangled wilderness besides Casson. He
understood them, and they loved and trusted him.
He was scarcely ever lonesome when with them.</p>

<p>It was very bad to be lonesome. That ache
was more terrible to Bomba than any tearing of
his flesh. He shrank from it as he did from no
physical pain. It was really the poignant longing
in him for his own kind, but Bomba knew it only
as a strange illness, an ache not of his body but
of some mysterious part of him of which he had
no knowledge.</p>

<p>So now, feeling this sickness creeping over him,
he felt irresistibly the impulse to fly from it, to
seek forgetfulness among the only friends he
knew.</p>

<p>The jungle boy determined to take his harmonica,
too. His eyes brightened at the thought.
He had now learned to make the instrument emit
the sounds he, Bomba, wished. Perhaps the
monkeys and parrots would like it. At least they
would be surprised and inquisitive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>Bomba had two good reasons to give Casson
for his trip. They needed game. They had been
living almost altogether upon the eggs of the
jaboties, or forest turtles, and even to a jungle
palate, easily satisfied, such a limited diet becomes
monotonous, if too long continued. Then,
too, he wanted to get in contact with some of the
more friendly natives and secure from them a
couple of hammocks to replace those that had
been destroyed in the fire.</p>

<p>When he announced his intention to Casson,
the old man merely nodded in an absent manner
and went on with what he was doing. So Bomba
took his machete, his bow and arrows, his precious
fire stick and his harmonica, and plunged
into the jungle, not without repeated injunctions
to Casson to be on the alert if the head-hunters
should come, and, if he had time, to try to escape
down the river.</p>

<p>Bomba had not gone far before he began to
see among the trees and in the branches the faces
of his wild friends peering at him with their
bright eyes.</p>

<p>He called to them softly, and they came to him.
Kiki and Woowoo, the parrots, perched on his
shoulders and pecked affectionately at his face.</p>

<p>Doto, the great monkey, swung from branch
to branch close above his head, now and again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
playfully dropping a bunch of leaves upon him.
Bomba felt soothed and comforted.</p>

<p>These wild folk loved and trusted him. He
was one of them. He belonged here in the heart
of the jungle. It must be so.</p>

<p>Yet all the time some mysterious voice within
him whispered that it was not so. He did not
belong here. He was no caboclo, no Indian.
What was he then? Where did he belong?</p>

<p>Bartow! Laura! He felt that in these words
must lie the solution of the enigma. Over and
over the words ran through his mind, until it
seemed that even the chattering monkeys overhead
must hear them.</p>

<p>Feeling the loneliness again creeping over him,
Bomba sat down on a log and took out his mouth
organ. He would gather his friends around him.
They would help him to fight off the sickness that
came from nowhere and did not hurt his body—hurt
only that mysterious part of him that he
did not understand.</p>

<p>But the first weird notes on the harmonica had
a queer effect upon the jungle denizens. They
had begun to cluster about the boy, as they always
did when he appeared among them. But at the
wail of the curious thing that Bomba held to his
mouth they disappeared. If they had suddenly
been sucked down to the muddy bottom of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
ygapo, the place could not have seemed more
utterly deserted.</p>

<p>Bomba looked surprised for a moment. Then
he smiled, his teeth showing dazzling white
against his brown skin.</p>

<p>He whistled softly and called:</p>

<p>“Doto! Doto! Where are you?”</p>

<p>There was a slight rustling of leaves in a tree
near by, and Doto peered cautiously through the
branches. His brow was wrinkled in a scowl
that seemed to say he was not at all sure that
Bomba was not playing some practical joke on
him.</p>

<p>“Look! Nice music! Not hurt Doto!”</p>

<p>Bomba held his mouth organ out to the big
monkey, so that he might get a better look at it.</p>

<p>“Nice music,” said Bomba again. “Listen!”</p>

<p>Once more he put the harmonica to his lips and
blew a plaintive wail into the reaches of the
jungle.</p>

<p>A response came that was as startling as it
was unexpected.</p>

<p>There was a thunderous roar, a crashing of
the undergrowth, and a great jaguar bounded into
view!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<span class="fs80">PLAYING FOR HIS LIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For a moment Bomba was so taken aback by
the sight of the jaguar that he did not stir.</p>

<p>His harmonica was still between his lips, and
the sudden exclamation that was forced from him
droned through the mouth organ in a weird, discordant
note.</p>

<p>The wailing cry had a strange and instant
effect upon the beast. It had crouched as though
for a spring, but now it hesitated. It had never
seen a human with a gleaming mouth like that. It
had never heard that kind of sound. The jungle
beast is a creature of habit. Anything new is
disconcerting.</p>

<p>Bomba noted instantly the effect, and took advantage
of it. He could see that the beast was
bewildered and a bit daunted. He wished, if possible,
to avoid a physical contest with the huge
creature at such close quarters.</p>

<p>So, while his right hand stole slowly to the
revolver in his belt, he maintained the harmonica
at his mouth with his left and launched into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
refrain that had no melody but which was a mere
mass of discordant notes.</p>

<p>The tense attitude of the jaguar relaxed and
he settled down on his haunches, his greenish-yellow
eyes fastened on Bomba, who in turn
stared at him with equal intensity.</p>

<p>The boy was vibrating with excitement, but he
let no sign of this appear. Everything depended
on his keeping his nerve. The beast was evidently
uncertain what to do.</p>

<p>As Bomba played on, there flashed through his
mind a story that Casson had told him in a moment
of expansion, a story of the snake charmers
in a faraway land of which Bomba had forgotten
the name. Casson had said that when these men
had played on a musical instrument, fierce and
poisonous snakes had become as mild and harmless
as rabbits and had submitted to be handled
without a thought of resistance.</p>

<p>To be sure, a jaguar was not a snake, but might
not the same rule apply? He had already seen
that he had laid a sort of spell on the creature.
How long would it last?</p>

<p>In any event, he had his knife and the revolver
as last resorts. And so he kept on
playing. He did not know how long he could
keep it up; but he was committed to the test.
Perhaps he was playing for his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>One thing he was quick to notice. When he
played softly, the jaguar showed evidence of
pleasure. Its muscles seemed to relax, and had
it not been for the noise he was making Bomba
was sure he could have heard it purr.</p>

<p>But when the notes swelled out more sharply
the brute moved restlessly and whined. It shook
its head, as though to shake the noise from its
ears. The strain jarred upon it, hurt it.</p>

<p>Bomba hardly knew how to interpret this.
Would the louder notes stir the beast to anger
and attack? Or would it create in it such pain
and discomfort that it would seek refuge in
retreat?</p>

<p>On the mere chance of the latter solution, he
abandoned the softer strain altogether and blew
with all his might. He was risking everything on
a single cast.</p>

<p>The answer was not long in coming. The look
that came into the jaguar’s eyes was not of rage
but of confusion and distress. It scrambled to
its feet, looked about uncertainly for a moment,
and then turned tail and slunk off into the jungle.</p>

<p>Bomba kept on playing until he was sure that
the brute was far away. Then the reaction came
on him, and he sank down on the ground, weak
and limp and covered with perspiration.</p>

<p>With his immense relief was mingled a new
sense of gratitude to the white men. Twice now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
their gifts had saved his life. Was there any
limit to their magic?</p>

<p>He did not know that the white men themselves
would have been astounded at this application
of their musical gift. All the jungle lad
looked at was the result. It was another link
that bound him to the men who seemed in some
vague way to bind Bomba’s destiny to the race
to which he belonged.</p>

<p>He was aroused from his reflections by a
squeak from the branches above, and, looking up,
he saw the face of Doto, who had disappeared
like a flash at the entrance of the jaguar upon
the scene and had now ventured back.</p>

<p>With a glint of mischief in his eyes, Bomba
blew a few notes on the harmonica. Again Doto
darted back, but not with such alarm as before.</p>

<p>When the monkey’s face again looked through
the branches, Bomba managed to coax him
nearer and nearer until at last he dropped from
the lowest branch and squatted close to the boy
on the ground.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this show of daring on the part
of one of their number, the others began to return,
peering cautiously at first and from a distance,
but coming closer as their curiosity drove
them on.</p>

<p>At last, when he had played them all back to
him and Woowoo and Kiki were once more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
perched trustingly on his shoulders, Bomba passed
the mouth organ to Doto.</p>

<p>Doto took it hesitantly, drawing back his hands
several times before his long fingers closed firmly
on the strange toy. The excited chattering of the
monkeys mingled with the raucous notes of the
parrots as they flaunted their gorgeous plumage
about the boy’s head.</p>

<p>Doto regarded the strange instrument with a
good deal of concentration. He was not at all
sure that he liked it. It took Bomba some time
to persuade him to put it to his lips. Then by
expelling his breath sharply several times he
finally made the monkey understand that he
wanted him to blow on it.</p>

<p>One horrible squawk issued from the harmonica.
Then Doto dropped it on the ground
like a shot and scuttled in panic to the nearest
tree.</p>

<p>Some of the more timid among the flock followed
him, but most of them remained with
Bomba. One young monkey, bolder than the rest,
picked up the instrument.</p>

<p>Instantly Doto dropped from the tree, chattering
angrily. He boxed the ears of the young
monkey soundly and snatched the harmonica from
him. He handled the plaything gingerly and held
it out to Bomba.</p>

<p>The boy showed his white teeth in an amused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
smile and took back the instrument. Doto did
not want it, but he was going to make sure that
no other monkey got it!</p>

<p>It was good to be here in the jungle with his
friends. Bomba would have been glad to stay
longer, but there was still much for him to do
and he must not leave Casson too long alone.</p>

<p>So reluctantly he said good-bye to them, though
they besought him in their way to stay, and set
off toward the ygapo.</p>

<p>He had scarcely started when there arose such
an excited tumult in the trees that he knew something
out of the ordinary had happened or was
about to happen.</p>

<p>He seized a low-lying branch and swung himself
into a tree.</p>

<p>The screeching and howling increased in volume,
and through the foliage of the trees Bomba
could see a veritable swarm of monkeys approaching
him. They swung from branch to branch in
frantic haste, howling with rage and fear.</p>

<p>They were in trouble! They were coming to
him for help!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br>
<span class="fs80">THE CLOUD OF VULTURES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bomba dropped to the ground and waited.</p>

<p>In a moment the monkeys were upon him,
dropping from the branches and surrounding him,
crowding against him, howling and jabbering all
at once.</p>

<p>Bomba drew one red-faced old ape aside. It
was the leader of the swarm.</p>

<p>“Tatuc, ba?” asked Bomba, meaning in monkey
language, “Tatuc, what is wrong?”</p>

<p>In the jabbering monosyllable chatter, which
Bomba from years of intimacy and observation
had come to understand sufficiently to get its essential
meaning, Tatuc gave the boy the news
that his flock had been attacked by a swarm of
vultures while trying to defend two of their
young that the voracious birds had swooped down
upon, with the intention of carrying them off to
their retreats, where they could devour them at
leisure.</p>

<p>The resistance had infuriated the birds, who
were coming in numbers. And the monkeys, timid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
folk at best except when they were cornered, had
come to Bomba for help.</p>

<p>Even as Bomba gathered this from Tatuc’s
chattering, a sinister whirring of wings sounded
and a cloud of the birds of prey swept down
through and under the trees.</p>

<p>Except when attacked or thwarted of their
prey, the vultures rarely attack living creatures,
preferring to feast in safety and at leisure upon
carrion.</p>

<p>But when the latter is scarce, they do not
hesitate to swoop down upon lambs or other
small game and carry them off. In this instance
the young monkeys had been tempting bait, and
the attempt of the mothers to defend their offspring
had aroused the ferocity of the vultures,
never far from the surface, and had prompted
this wholesale raid in reprisal.</p>

<p>Against these creatures the monkeys had little
defense. They could only fly from them, and
quick as they were, the wings of the great birds
were swifter.</p>

<p>Now the monkeys crowded close to Bomba,
chattering and howling, begging for his protection.
He had power. Had they not seen the
jaguar slink away from him? Why should he
not also disperse the vultures?</p>

<p>As the black pursuing crowd of vultures came
closer, Bomba reached for the revolver, balancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
it in his strong brown fingers. The expression
of his mouth was grim, but in his heart was
already coming the delight of battle.</p>

<p>Again that feeling of power swept over him.
In all his contests with bird or beast or reptile of
the jungle he had never faced them with such a
sense of mastery as now. The revolver, gift of
the white men, made all the difference—that
deadly little toy from the mouth of which spurted
fire and death.</p>

<p>As the ominous cloud swept closer, thickening
overhead, Bomba set his sturdy brown legs wide
apart and fired into the midst of it.</p>

<p>The friendly monkeys at first were more scared
by the report than by the attacking vultures.
They shrank away from Bomba, screaming more
wildly than before. What had happened? Was
their best friend turning against them?</p>

<p>But Bomba shouted to them reassuringly and
again shot into the swarm of vultures.</p>

<p>Two of them fell with a great flapping of wings
into the underbrush, while a third, one wing
drooping, blundered off through the trees.</p>

<p>The attack was halted. Bewildered by the
noise of the shots and the spurts of flame, as well
as by the fall of some of their number, the great
birds fluttered about uncertainly, beating the air
with their wings and filling the air with raucous
squawks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>The respite, however, was only temporary.
The assailants swooped down again, with wicked
claws outstretched and cruel curved beaks ready
for action.</p>

<p>One of them darted forward and seized a baby
monkey, tearing it from the mother’s arms. A
long agonized howl came from the bereaved
female. She sprang into the air and clutched
wildly at the tiny helpless bundle in the claws of
the vulture.</p>

<p>The great wide-spread wings of the attackers
were so close that Bomba was fanned by them.
He shielded his eyes instinctively with one arm
against the rip of beak and claw. With the
other hand he slowly raised the revolver, trained
it upon the vulture with the baby monkey in its
talons, tightened his finger on the trigger and
fired.</p>

<p>The shot struck no vital part, because Bomba
had feared to injure the little captive. But he
succeeded in breaking the wing of the vulture.
With a shrill squeak it dropped its prey, and with
its uninjured wing flapping clumsily, disappeared
above the trees.</p>

<p>The mother monkey leaped forward, seized
her baby, hugged it to her breast and crouched
low above it, interposing her body between it
and danger.</p>

<p>The vultures returned to the attack with redoubled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
fury. The opposition they encountered
served only to enrage them the more. They
came in smothering masses, and there ensued a
fight that Bomba never forgot.</p>

<p>The monkeys, brought to bay, fought viciously
for their lives. But without the aid of Bomba
the odds would have been too much for them.
And even the boy, armed with his new death-dealing
weapon, had need of all his strength and
agility to withstand the attack of the predatory
birds.</p>

<p>He fought them off as well as he could, wielding
his machete with his left hand, shooting when
he could, carpeting the ground about him with
dead or wounded birds.</p>

<p>But always they came on. There seemed no
end of them. His flesh was scratched and torn
in a dozen places where powerful wing or beak
had raked him.</p>

<p>A hurried glance told him that his friends, the
monkeys were suffering horribly. The dead were
piled in heaps. Several vultures had seized upon
living prey and were making their way toward
their home fastnesses.</p>

<p>Raging, Bomba continued to shoot until the
cartridges in the weapon were exhausted and the
ominous click without a report told him the fire
stick needed reloading. He dared not take time
for this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>But he still had his bow and arrows and he
dropped the revolver and machete and had recourse
to those primitive weapons.</p>

<p>Primitive they might be, but in his hands they
were deadly. Every time his bow twanged the
arrow found its mark. At such close quarters the
missile went clear through the body of his target,
protruding from the farther side.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the boy that he never
thought of flight. At any moment he could have
found refuge in one of the many dense thickets
of the vicinity that no bird could penetrate.
There he could have waited in perfect security
until the fight was over and the raiders had
dispersed.</p>

<p>But an ingrained sense of loyalty to his tree-living
friends made even the thought impossible.
They had come to him. They were fighting
against terrible odds. They relied on him to help
them. Would he desert them in their extremity,
forfeit the confidence they had in him? Not
while breath remained in his body.</p>

<p>It seemed as though that breath were not going
to remain very much longer. He could scarcely
draw air into his bursting lungs. His chest
seemed bound with iron bands. His strength was
deserting him. He was fairly trembling with
fatigue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>But his indomitable will was as strong as ever.
He had a wild Berserker rage against these fiendish,
ferocious enemies from the air, these pirates
of the ether. For every wound he got from beak
or talon he was determined to exact a death in
return.</p>

<p>But his arrows would soon be gone. Then it
would come to a hand-to-hand fight with the
machete. But that weapon was only effective
when wielded by a strong hand. He might strike
with it, wound with it, but in his present wearied
state he could not kill. And when it should drop
from his paralyzed hand—But Bomba would not
allow himself to think of what would happen
after that.</p>

<p>Now his last arrow was really gone, and the
vultures seemed more numerous than ever. Reinforcements
had come to their depleted ranks.</p>

<p>Bomba stooped over and picked up his machete.
But to his dismay he found that he could not lift
it above his head. His numbed muscles had rebelled
at last and refused to obey his will.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, mysteriously, the heavy cloud
lifted. Bomba heard the whirring of wings in
retreat. He looked up. The vultures had
gathered as though in obedience to a signal and
were winging their way above the trees.</p>

<p>For a moment the jungle boy did not know
what to make of the sudden flight of his enemies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
From his place on the ground he could not know
what had startled the vultures.</p>

<p>Then he heard the cries and whimperings of
the monkeys.</p>

<p>At the same time Bomba heard the rushing of
wind through the jungle. It came with a roar
like that of surf pounding upon the shore.</p>

<p>“The great wind!” cried Bomba, and raised his
bleeding arms toward the sky.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE WRATH OF THE STORM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The great wind, the forerunner of the tropical
thunderstorm, had come at the moment of
Bomba’s greatest need.</p>

<p>All creatures of the jungle fly to shelter before
the fury of the storm. Bomba knew this full
well, as did all living creatures of these wilds,
large and small.</p>

<p>At the first blast of that fierce gale the parrakeets
flew screaming to shelter. The animals of
the forests rushed for their dens and the earth
dwellers scurried into their holes.</p>

<p>Even the savage vultures retreated before the
onset of the gale and the rain of castanha nuts
shaken from the bending trees. Broken wings
and broken heads would have resulted from the
downfall of those dreaded missiles, heavy enough
with their cups to kill a man.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the vultures winged upward in
retreat before a second and stronger rush of wind
warned Bomba and the group of bleeding and
mourning monkeys, in whose behalf he had fought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
so stoutly, that the storm was preparing to burst.</p>

<p>Some of the monkeys had lost their young,
others their mates. What affected Bomba most
was the sight of old Tatuc lying dead on the
ground in a pool of blood, his teeth imbedded in
the neck of the vulture that he had taken to death
with him.</p>

<p>But there was no time for mourning now.
Tragedies like these were common in the cruel
jungle where the life of one thrived on the death
of others. So while a bitter ache shot through
Bomba at the loss of Tatuc, his best and oldest
friend of the monkey tribe, he dared not linger
in the spot.</p>

<p>He gave a sharp word of command to the
monkeys, dazed by the loss of their chief, and
bade them seek shelter in the upper branches of
the trees.</p>

<p>They obeyed slowly, bewilderedly, scarcely
seeming to care much what happened to them,
leaving their dead behind them on the ground.
They would furnish a fine feast for the hungry
vultures when they returned to the battlefield, as
Bomba knew they would when the storm had
passed.</p>

<p>But Bomba could not bear to leave Tatuc there
at the mercy of his foes. It revolted him to
think that the vultures should have him. He
had been unable to save his life, but something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
prompted him to one last act of affection for his
old friend. So he picked up the body, threw it
over his shoulder and as rapidly as he could made
his way to a safer place.</p>

<p>It was high time. The trees were bending before
the lashing of the wind. The heavy castanha
nuts were already beginning to fall with heavy
thuds upon the ground. The sky above the
waving crests of the trees showed a weird, leaden
gray. The storm was ready to burst.</p>

<p>Bomba had scarcely taken a dozen steps carrying
his heavy burden when the tempest broke.
The rain came down in a stinging, blinding deluge
that scourged him as though with whips.
The wind increased to a gale, which, luckily, was
at his back. No living thing could have faced it
without being swept from its feet.</p>

<p>Bomba was swept along almost without his
own volition. Head down, with the dead body
of Tatuc held close to his own, he progressed
more by the sense of touch than sight, heading
toward a deserted native hut that he knew lay
at a little distance.</p>

<p>The lightning cut the black of the sky with
vicious thrusts. Crash after crash of thunder
seemed to shake the very ground beneath the
lad’s feet. But he reached the hut at last, and,
climbing the prostrate deep-notched tree trunk that
led to its entrance, slippery now with the rain, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
deposited his lifeless burden on the floor, composed
of a few rotting boards.</p>

<p>It was a typical native hut of the jungle. Long
ago it had been deserted by its one-time tenants.
It consisted of a few upright poles set in the
ground, with cross supports to hold them steady.
The flooring was made of split pieces of palm
trunks, sagging in places.</p>

<p>The walls had been made of the same material,
but now only two sides were left standing, the
others being open to the assault of wind and
weather. A light framework of thinner saplings
supported the flimsy roof. This was made of
the leaves of the ubussu palm, placed so that they
overlapped one another.</p>

<p>Hundreds of creeping insects crawled slimily
beneath the roof and now and then dropped upon
the shoulders and head of Bomba, as he sat
hunched up and brooding beside the body of the
dead monkey, Tatuc, leader of the flock.</p>

<p>Once it was a scorpion that fell on the lad, and
he was forced to act quickly to kill the creature,
before it could inject into his veins the deadly
poison of its bite.</p>

<p>For a long time Bomba sat brooding beside
his dead companion. The rain swept down in
torrents. The lightning crashed and the thunder
roared and all nature was in pandemonium.</p>

<p>But the storms of the jungle, fierce while they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
last, are seldom of long duration. When at last
the rain ceased and the last reverberating peal
of thunder died away in the distance, Bomba rose
with a sigh and for a few moments left Tatuc
alone on the broken flooring of the hut.</p>

<p>Then with the machete and a sharp stick that
he found near by, he dug a rude grave for his
friend. The ground was soft, and the task did
not take long.</p>

<p>This done, Bomba went to the hut, lifted the
body of Tatuc, bore it to the long narrow hole
in the ground, and placed the remains in it.</p>

<p>The boy stood for several minutes, head
bowed, heart heavy, looking mournfully at all
that was left of the friend whom he had known
and cherished for many years. Bomba had many
fond recollections of that friendship. It had
supplied in large part what he had lacked in
human companionship. How many times a visit
to Tatuc had relieved his sore and lonely heart!</p>

<p>“The vultures shall not have you, Tatuc,” he
said simply.</p>

<p>Then he covered the body with palm leaves
and over them put earth. He finished his work
by piling up a cairn of heavy stones, so that no
marauding beast of the jungle should search out
the resting place of his friend.</p>

<p>Then Bomba threw himself face downward
near the spot. He lay there for a long time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
motionless. He was swept by an intolerable
sense of loss.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he was a mere atom in
the world. Who would care whether he lived or
died? The white men were gone. He did not
believe that he would ever see them again.
Tatuc was gone. Casson was left. But Casson
had become a mere child again and could not
remember, did not want to talk, was wrapped
in apathy, as much of a companion as a stone
image.</p>

<p>But he had talked once, had almost remembered!
Perhaps if Bomba were patient he would
remember more one day. Then perhaps Bomba
would learn more of what he meant when he had
spoken those words that were indelibly engraven
upon the boy’s memory, “Bartow,” “Laura.”</p>

<p>Bomba raised himself from the ground and for
the last time stood beside the grave of Tatuc.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” he murmured, and then he choked.</p>

<p>Turning and dashing the tears from his eyes,
he plunged into the rain-drenched jungle.</p>

<p>Turned, though he knew it not, toward a more
grisly peril than he had yet encountered!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<span class="fs80">GRIPPED</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The fury of the storm was over, but evidences
of it remained.</p>

<p>Castanha nuts lay thick upon the ground.
Here a tree had been riven by lightning from
top to base. There a forest monarch, uprooted
by the gale, lay prostrate.</p>

<p>Again and again Bomba was compelled to make
detours. But he advanced rapidly, nevertheless,
so much was he a part of the jungle. He avoided
upflung roots and intertwining vines as though
by instinct.</p>

<p>At times he had to use his machete to force a
way for himself through the bushes. In other
places, where the undergrowth was not too high,
he progressed after the manner of the Indians,
in a succession of deer-like leaps that carried him
over the obstacles in his path.</p>

<p>His steps now led him toward the ygapo, for
it was necessary for him to pass through the
swamp before reaching the river beyond which
lay the maloca of the Araos, a comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
friendly tribe with whom he and Casson had had
no differences, although there was never any
intimacy between them.</p>

<p>From these he hoped to obtain a pair of cotton
hammocks to replace those that had been burned
in the fire that had visited the hut. He would
gather something on the way to pay for them, perhaps
a jaboty or agouti, or possibly some eggs of
the forest tortoise, which were always acceptable
to natives of the region.</p>

<p>He might, too, learn something about the plans
of the head-hunters, if those fierce foes were still
in that part of the jungle. Since his first encounter,
he had seen no traces of them, although
the thought of them was always in the back of
his mind.</p>

<p>As Casson had said, the savages were like
children, as far as fixity of purpose was concerned.
They were ignorant and superstitious, and any
unlooked-for incident might be interpreted by
them as a sign of the displeasure of their gods
at their present expedition and make them return
to their home near the Giant Cataract.</p>

<p>But Bomba knew that such good luck was not
to be relied on. He knew that at this very
moment the band of invaders might be searching
the jungle, intent on taking the life of Casson,
and that in all likelihood they would try to complete
their work by taking his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>But it was likely that the Araos would know
something of the whereabouts of the head-hunters,
who were as much a foe of theirs as of
the two whites. Bomba thought he might make
some kind of a treaty with the more friendly
natives to help him and Casson in case of need,
or at least to keep him informed by some swift
courier of any threatening developments.</p>

<p>Nature was beautiful in the jungle after the
storm. The sky above was turquoise and the air,
washed clean by rain, was like topaz. The vivid
green of the shrubs and the grasses shone like
emerald.</p>

<p>The living things had come out from the
shelters to which they had been driven by the
tempest. Clouds of mazarine-colored butterflies
flitted from flower to flower. Humming-birds,
green-backed, lily-breasted, with purple throat
and crest, darted hither and thither like living
gems, with a hundred firelike reflections scintillating
from their little bodies.</p>

<p>Then there were the trogons, motmots and
kingfishers glowing with iridescent hues, flocks of
scarlet macaws, flamingoes almost equally gorgeous,
each standing on one long slender leg and
basking in the sun; herons, plover, toucans and
scores of other curious birds that make the
Amazon jungle the most wonderful natural aviary
on earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>Bomba had the soul of a poet, and the beauty
of it all sank deep. For a time he almost forgot
his errand, so entranced was he by the glories
spread so lavishly about him. He paused to look
about in delight mingled with wonder that such
loveliness could exist.</p>

<p>Not only the living things, but the plants and
trees and flowers had their appeal to him. There
was the giant mora tree, two hundred feet high,
aglow with clusters of scarlet blossoms, feathery
palms, the bright yellow trumpet flower with
blooms so large that they were worn as hats by
the Indian women and children, huge fuchsias
with their purplish tubular bells, heliotrope,
verbenas, orchids, glowing with all the colors of
the rainbow.</p>

<p>The whole region was ablaze with beauty beyond
the power of an artist to paint or the
imagination of a dreamer to conceive.</p>

<p>As Bomba approached the edge of the ygapo,
however, the beauty began to fade, and nature
assumed a more sombre aspect. The riot of
color died on the borders of the swamp, and its
place was taken by drabness and desolation.</p>

<p>With a feeling of sick distaste Bomba left the
region that had almost made him lose himself
in dreams and began to thread the mazes of the
swamp.</p>

<p>Part of it was intersected with deep pools, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
which he had to wade, sometimes to the waist.
Other sections were comparatively free from
water, but deep in mud.</p>

<p>But Bomba knew the swamp as he knew the
jungle, knew how to keep a reasonably straight
course through the pathless waste and how to
avoid the deeper and more dangerous parts.</p>

<p>He had gone about halfway across the dismal
place when he came upon a sight that chilled the
blood in his veins. Used as he was to the presence
of all sorts of reptiles in the jungle, and
especially in the ygapo, he was filled with a sensation
of loathing and disgust as he viewed the
scene before him.</p>

<p>In a shallow, muddy pool, about thirty feet
in front of him, he saw a mass of writhing snakes,
gray in color like the mud in which they wallowed.</p>

<p>“Sucurujus!” muttered Bomba, as he saw that
the group embraced scores of the dreaded anacondas
of the Amazon.</p>

<p>They were of all sizes, some of them six or
seven feet in length, others three times as long.</p>

<p>They seemed at first to take no notice of
Bomba. Most of them were sleeping, some with
their bodies half-submerged beneath the lukewarm,
shallow ooze. Others had crawled upon
the bodies of their comrades, while still others
lay lazily on the borders of the pool, basking in
the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>Lucky for him, thought Bomba, that he had
not been crossing the ygapo after the setting of
the sun had bathed the swamp in darkness. To
have stepped into that crawling mass would have
meant certain and horrible death.</p>

<p>Bomba hated the anaconda more than he did
any other denizen of the jungle. That hate dated
back to the time he had been attacked by one of
the reptiles and Casson had fired the rifle, which,
though it frightened away the anaconda, had had
such dire results to poor Casson himself.</p>

<p>His hand fell on the butt of his revolver, which
he had taken care to load again while he was in
the little native hut, after he had buried Tatuc.
It was a tempting target that offered itself to
him.</p>

<p>A few shots into that writhing mass would
take a terrible toll. In a sense, it would take
revenge for Casson’s injury. His finger itched
to pull the trigger.</p>

<p>But he restrained himself. It would be well to
let well enough alone. They were lazy and
somnolent, scarcely aware of his presence. Why
provoke a conflict which he might avoid?</p>

<p>Besides, cartridges were precious, and he must
conserve them.</p>

<p>So, with a sigh, he restrained the impulse and,
edging his way to the right, he made a wide
circle about the nest of snakes, watching the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
ground carefully, lest one of the monsters should
cross his path.</p>

<p>But it was from above that danger came.</p>

<p>A dark, sinister, rope-like body slithered
silently from a tree above Bomba’s head.</p>

<p>The next instant what seemed a band of iron
tightened about the boy’s chest!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br>
<span class="fs80">IN THE FOLDS OF A BOA CONSTRICTOR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A thrill of terror ran through Bomba.</p>

<p>He knew in an instant what had happened.
A great boa, lying in wait for whatever living
thing might pass beneath the tree, had darted
down upon him. The coils of the great snake
were tightening upon him inexorably.</p>

<p>For a moment he gave himself up for lost.
And lost he inevitably would have been, had the
snake retained the grip of its tail upon the bough.
This it was that gave it the purchase required
for squeezing its prey to death.</p>

<p>But the bough was slippery from the recent
rain, and the fury of the reptile’s sudden dart
tore the tail loose from the point of support.</p>

<p>The great body fell with a thud. The coils
did not relax. But on the other hand they could
not tighten until the snake, lashing wildly about,
could find some stump or tree to encircle with its
tail and use it as a lever.</p>

<p>Bomba felt as though his lungs were bursting,
his ribs cracking. He expected every second to be
crushed into a shapeless mass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>The snake had wound about his body, but the
boy’s arms remained free. Desperately he felt
for his machete. He drew it forth from its
sheath with his right hand and slashed furiously
at the enfolding coils.</p>

<p>For a moment the iron bands seemed to press
all the closer. The infuriated reptile raised its
horrid head and struck at the boy’s neck. Bomba
dodged, and the fangs buried themselves in his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Again and again Bomba lashed out frantically
with his knife. Each time the weapon found its
mark. Bomba could feel that the coils were
relaxing slightly.</p>

<p>Once more the terrible head was raised high
in the air for another blow. And at that instant
a lucky slash went deep and severed the spinal
cord.</p>

<p>The threatened blow never descended. The
head wavered and fell. Bomba grasped it with
his left hand and, summoning all his strength,
struck the reptile in the throat, completely severing
the head from the body. The coils unwound
and fell in a heap at the boy’s feet.</p>

<p>Bomba threw the head from him with a sharp
exclamation of disgust, mingled with relief, and
stepped quickly to one side to escape the flailing
of the writhing, twisting body of the headless
boa constrictor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>He had been close to death. Only the slipping
of the snake’s tail from the slippery bough had
saved him. His brave heart alone would not
have availed.</p>

<p>With a shudder of repulsion he examined his
foe, after the thrashing had subsided and the
great snake lay quiet.</p>

<p>Bomba had seen much larger snakes, but this
was quite large enough, the boy reflected, as he
rubbed his chest, bruised and sore from the
pressure of the folds. The reptile was about
twelve feet long and as thick as Bomba’s leg.</p>

<p>The horrible head, lying a little distance from
the body, still gaped at him, though the malignant
glitter of the eyes had been glazed by death.
Bomba shuddered as he thought how nearly those
awful fangs had been imbedded in his throat.
But they had sunk into his shoulder.</p>

<p>Now, as well as he could, he examined the
wound. It was causing him severe pain, but no
apprehension. He knew that the boa constrictor
carried no poison in its jaws. Its terrible crushing
power was its main reliance. His shoulder
would be sore for a few days, and that was all.
He cleansed the wound with water from a pool,
and then wiped his bloody hunting knife on a wad
of leaves.</p>

<p>“You did well,” he said aloud, addressing his
trusty weapon as he thrust it back into his girdle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
of cloth. “You have served Bomba many times,
but never better than this.”</p>

<p>Once more he went on his way, but, warned
by his adventure, his eyes scanned the trees above
him as carefully as they did the ground before
him.</p>

<p>Before long he had passed through the dreary
ygapo and heard in the distance the musical
tinkle of a waterfall. It was a sound that made
his heart leap with pleasure. Again and again he
had viewed the fall, entranced, as the spray-crested
torrent dashed over the lip of the cliff
into the whirling vortex of water beneath that
formed the first of the series of great rapids
rushing onward to the river.</p>

<p>Bomba loved the waterfall. It spoke to him
in a vague and mystic way of forces unchained.
As he came now in full sight of it, there was
something in the power and wild beauty of the
rushing waters that struck an answering chord
in his soul, causing his blood to run more swiftly
and making his eyes kindle with delight.</p>

<p>What made him feel that way? Bomba
brooded over this, as he brooded over many of
the strange thoughts and emotions that puzzled
him.</p>

<p>He wondered if the caboclos felt as he did
about this magnificent cascade. He remembered
that he had seen one of them come out from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
jungle and stand for a moment above the rushing
waters, looking down upon them.</p>

<p>There had been no change in the expression of
the caboclo. He had not seemed to be drinking
in the beauty of it all. If the man had loved the
waterfall as Bomba did, his face would have
lighted up and his eyes would have laughed, as
Bomba had seen his own laugh one day when he
had suddenly seen his face reflected in the
pellucid waters of a lovely pool.</p>

<p>Bomba had not known himself then. He had
started back from the image in the pool as though
from some mysterious thing hiding beneath the
surface of the water. But when, gaining courage,
he had again peered over the rim, his face looked
back at him, and he knew it was his own.</p>

<p>But the face now was puzzled and solemn. It
had lost the first laughing look, the look of some
one on whom a radiant vision has burst. He
tried again to laugh, but it was not the same. The
laughter was forced. What a strange changing
mixture of emotions he possessed! He was something,
then, besides form and features. There
was more in him than he could touch and see.
Could it be perhaps because he had something
that the white men had called a soul? What
was this soul?</p>

<p>Many, many lonely hours Bomba had spent
wondering about this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Why did he never see that look upon the face
of Casson? Why did the faces of the natives
always wear to Bomba the same dull and stupid
look, as dull and stupid, Bomba thought, and
often more so, than the faces of his jungle
friends? Why were the faces of the Indians
always the same, except when they darkened and
grew fierce and stern? Why did beauty not appeal
to them as it did to him?</p>

<p>Bomba felt sure that the native tribes who
lived within sight and sound of the great cascade,
who could feast their eyes on it whenever they
would, did not love it as he did. They thought
of it only as the abode of spirits, some good, most
of them bad, and believed that the evil spirits
walked at night. During the dark hours they
remained close within the circle of the maloca,
where the night fires burned bright.</p>

<p>Bomba did not believe that evil spirits dwelt
in the waterfall. It was beautiful, and to Bomba
beautiful things were good.</p>

<p>Why did they feel so differently from him?
Was it because they did not have souls? He
dismissed this thought as improbable. But perhaps
their souls were asleep. Ah, that must be
it! They were asleep!</p>

<p>But his was awake. At least it was waking.
Perhaps that was because he was white. The
thought gave him a thrill. Now he was sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
that he had found the truth. The natives’ souls
were asleep. The white men’s souls were awake.
And he was white!</p>

<p>He had been so absorbed in his broodings that
he had become almost oblivious of the passage
of time. A glance at the sun startled him. He
must hurry.</p>

<p>With a last lingering look at the beautiful
cascade and a mental resolve to return to it soon,
he struck off at a tangent into the jungle, gliding
along silently and swiftly, eager to make up for
the time he had spent in dreaming.</p>

<p>He reproached himself for having lingered.
Why had he forgotten for the moment Casson,
poor old helpless Casson, left alone in the hut,
an easy prey to the stealthy head-hunters if they
should succeed in ferreting out his location.</p>

<p>He was hurrying along when he suddenly
stopped short.</p>

<p>In his path were the freshly made tracks of a
jaguar!</p>

<span class="fs80">AT THE WATER HOLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bomba’s hand went swiftly to his revolver as
his keen eyes swept the surrounding jungle.</p>

<p>Nothing ominous met his straining sight.
There was no sign of the dreaded monarch of the
forest.</p>

<p>This, however, was but little reassuring.
Bomba knew the stealth of the cruel beast, as
subtle as it was ferocious. Its tawny hide was
little discernible from the grasses and shrubs of
the jungle.</p>

<p>Perhaps at this very moment its greenish-yellow
eyes were fastened upon him from the
shelter of some thicket. Possibly it was crouching
on a branch of one of the overhanging trees,
its body flattened so close to the bough that it
seemed a part of the tree itself.</p>

<p>But it was best not to stand waiting too long.
He was as much in danger there as though he
were speeding through the jungle. Death might
pounce on him at any time. But he was glad of
the warning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>With his revolver held ready for instant use,
Bomba started again through the forest, his keen
eyes searching every tuft of underbrush and
scanning the branches of every tree under which
he passed.</p>

<p>Only after half an hour had passed without
incident did his tense nerves relax, though he
abated not a jot of his vigilance.</p>

<p>The jaguar had passed that way but a little
while before, but had probably not been aware of
the boy’s close proximity.</p>

<p>Bomba was thankful that not all the animals
of the jungle were his enemies. He had repeated
proofs of this as he moved swiftly along.</p>

<p>Monkeys followed his course through the
branches of the trees, chattering at him and playfully
throwing handfuls of leaves and small nuts
down on his head.</p>

<p>The parrots shrieked and screamed at him, and
once one of them dropped on his shoulders, accompanying
him on this moving perch a considerable
distance through the woods.</p>

<p>A little later Bomba came across a jaboty, or
forest turtle. He pounced upon it eagerly, and
trussing it up with bush cord, swung it, still alive,
across his shoulders. If he could also get an
agouti or a capivara, he would have something
to give the Araos when he should come upon
their maloca. He would not come empty-handed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
He would have delicacies that they prized, and
they would be ready to listen favorably to his
request for the hammocks in exchange.</p>

<p>For a long time he had been conscious of a
growing thirst. The heat and his exertions,
together with the exciting events to which he had
been a party, had parched his throat and lips.
His tongue felt swollen.</p>

<p>He looked around in the hope that he might
find a cactus. This he could slit with his machete
and secure as much as he wanted of the cooling
delicious waters that these plants store up, a
fact that, if known, would have saved the lives
of many of those who have perished of thirst in
the very shadow of the thorny plants.</p>

<p>But there was no cactus in the immediate vicinity,
and this denial of his need only served
to make his thirst more intense.</p>

<p>He knew that at a little distance from the line
he was traversing there was a water hole, fed by
subterranean springs that never ran dry. More
than once he had slaked his thirst at this.</p>

<p>He turned now and headed in that direction.
He was parched with a terrible thirst that only
dwellers in the jungle or the desert can know.</p>

<p>He had left the trail to take a short cut to the
water hole, for he knew the regular trail used by
the jungle beasts was still some distance ahead.</p>

<p>Suddenly he paused, his machete with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
he had been hewing his way, raised. He held
himself rigidly motionless. What was that he had
heard?</p>

<p>It was the slithering of a snake through the
underbrush, but a snake that, disturbed, was
gliding away from the intruding boy.</p>

<p>He was fast nearing the water hole. He
quickened his steps, licking his dry lips with his
parched tongue. A few minutes more and his
eyes would be gladdened by the sight of the pool,
its mirror-like surface reflecting back the heavy
foliage and the waving crest of palms that grew
close at its edge. What great draughts of that
cooling water he would drink! How he would
revel in its plenty!</p>

<p>But even the terrible thirst that tormented
Bomba could not rob him of his caution. He
knew that the creatures of the jungle resorted
there. So with extreme care he advanced toward
the fringe of trees that still hid the water hole
from view.</p>

<p>Silently he parted the bushes and looked
through.</p>

<p>What he saw there caused him to grind his
teeth with rage. A deep growl formed in his
arid throat. For that moment Bomba was all
primitive.</p>

<p>He was thirsty but he could not drink. Others
had reached the pool before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>Three pumas, the panthers of the Amazon,
had gathered at the water’s edge and were drinking
contentedly.</p>

<p>Again the growl in Bomba’s throat. He
raised his revolver in an impulsive gesture, but
quickly lowered it. Caution told him it was wiser
not to enrage such powerful foes. They were
three to one. Bomba still desired to live.</p>

<p>There was a movement behind him.</p>

<p>Bomba turned swiftly about, every muscle
tense to meet an attack from the newcomer!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br>
<span class="fs80">A BATTLE ROYAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There came the padding of feet and a pushing
aside of the bushes, and Bomba could see the
outlines of a great body of some member of the
four-footed tribe advancing toward him.</p>

<p>Some other denizen of the jungle coming to
refresh himself at the water hole. Bomba’s
pulses beat fast. There were enemies now behind
him as well as in front of him. They had
come to enjoy a drink. They might stay to enjoy
a feast, with Bomba furnishing the material for
the banquet. It was a gruesome prospect, and
Bomba could feel the chills creeping over him.</p>

<p>He gripped his weapon tightly, prepared to sell
his life dearly, though he knew that against such
odds he had no chance of escape.</p>

<p>The bushes parted and a great head looked
through.</p>

<p>Bomba raised his weapon, but he dropped it
again when he saw that head more distinctly. At
the same moment the newcomer raised his paw
in a gesture that Bomba knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>The boy thrust his revolver in his belt and
bounded toward the great puma.</p>

<p>“Polulu!” Bomba cried, and clapped the great
beast upon the flank, as a civilized boy might
have fondled a pet dog. “You have come in time.
You will get me my drink. Look!”</p>

<p>The puma rubbed his head against the boy,
and they went together toward the fringe of
trees.</p>

<p>When Polulu saw the other pumas at the pool
his eyes gleamed viciously, his tail swished the
bushes, and a growl started rumbling in his
throat.</p>

<p>For gentle as Polulu was with the boy who had
saved him when trapped by the tree, he was
fierceness itself as far as his fellows were concerned.
Because of this and his gigantic size and
strength, he was respected and feared by all the
other beasts of the jungle. He brooked no opposition,
and swept every one who dared to dispute
his rule remorselessly out of the way.</p>

<p>He had gathered that Bomba was thirsty but
was afraid to go near the pool because of the
foes that clustered there. Very well, Polulu
would see to that! His friend should have his
drink!</p>

<p>Bomba watched his companion with breathless
interest and curiosity, as Polulu stalked majestically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
through the heavy brush and approached
the other pumas on the edge of the pool.</p>

<p>They had stopped drinking, but still lingered
in the pleasant spot. It was plain by their attitudes
as they lounged among the soft wet ferns
at the water’s edge that they were in no hurry
to depart.</p>

<p>Polulu came steadily down toward them. As
he approached, the other pumas sprang to their
feet and gathered together at one side of the
pool, as though to combine against a common
enemy. Battle was in the air.</p>

<p>When he had almost reached them, Polulu
stopped and growled warningly.</p>

<p>Three growls answered him, and Polulu knew
that, confident in their numbers, they were accepting
the challenge. They were defying his
authority, a thing that none of them would have
dared do if alone.</p>

<p>Jungle bred as Bomba was and used to fighting
for his right to live, a momentary doubt entered
his heart as to whether he ought to ask Polulu,
his friend Polulu, to give battle against such odds
in a quarrel not his own.</p>

<p>But such thoughts were idle. In the jungle, if
one lived at all, one must not question but must
act. Moreover, the puma was filled now with the
excitement and joy of battle and could not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
stopped before victory or defeat had come to
him.</p>

<p>Polulu started forward, his big head swinging
from side to side, yellow eyes gleaming, lips
drawn back wickedly from his fangs.</p>

<p>Before him the other beasts gave ground
slowly, grudgingly, growling with increasing irritation
as they were crowded back toward the
jungle.</p>

<p>They were not really angry yet. Polulu’s
strange conduct bewildered them. They did not
know his object. Ordinarily the beasts shared
the water hole without dispute, their fighting instincts
subdued for the time by the gratification
of a common need.</p>

<p>But now they were growing fierce from this
summary eviction. When Polulu would have
driven them still further back, so as to give
Bomba free access to the water hole, their growls
grew more menacing and their bodies crouched
closer to the ground.</p>

<p>But they had been crowded a considerable distance
away from the pool, and Polulu turned and
looked at Bomba as though to assure him that
the way was clear.</p>

<p>Bomba would gladly have waited until the trio
of enemies were fairly out of sight. But he knew
now that Polulu would feel hurt and bewildered
if he did not come. It would make the brute seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
foolish. Had he not driven off Bomba’s enemies?
Was he not now standing guard? Did Bomba
distrust his power?</p>

<p>The boy no longer hesitated.</p>

<p>Swiftly, with great deer-like leaps, he covered
the distance to the edge of the water hole.</p>

<p>So sudden was the action that the great cats,
their eyes fastened on the least movement of
Polulu, were taken completely by surprise.</p>

<p>Bomba flung himself on the ground and had
drunk great draughts of the clear cold water
before they fairly grasped the situation.</p>

<p>Here was a new enemy. An enemy easier to
fight than Polulu. Their hair began to bristle
and they commenced to creep forward, their
bodies, still close to the ground, moving almost
as sinuously as so many snakes.</p>

<p>Polulu roared fiercely and struck at the nearest
puma, raking him with his sharp claws from
shoulder to thigh.</p>

<p>With a horrible scream of rage and pain, the
wounded puma sprang at Polulu. But the old
puma was quicker than the young one. His
powerful jaws clamped about the throat of his
adversary and worked savagely. No amount of
thrashing about or raking with claws could shake
off that grip.</p>

<p>The other pumas, temporarily daunted by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
terrible punishment that Polulu was inflicting,
began to creep toward Bomba.</p>

<p>The lad raised his revolver and pressed the
trigger. The bullet sped straight and true,
pierced the eye of the nearest puma and penetrated
to the brain.</p>

<p>The stricken beast leaped into the air and then
fell sprawling upon the ground.</p>

<p>The report seemed to madden the remaining
brute. With a howl of fury it sprang at Bomba.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, the boy dodged, missing by
a fraction of an inch the impact of that heavy
body and the death-dealing blow of the terrible
paw.</p>

<p>As Bomba leaped, his foot caught under a root,
and he almost fell. In his struggle to regain his
balance, the revolver fell from his hand.</p>

<p>The puma had turned and crouched for another
spring. Bomba had no time to stoop and recover
his weapon. The boy gave himself up for lost.</p>

<p>But even as the puma launched itself in its
spring, a great body shot across Bomba’s vision
and met the assailant in mid-air.</p>

<p>It was Polulu who had finished his first
opponent and now came to the rescue of his
friend.</p>

<p>Teeth tearing, claws going like piston rods,
the ferocious brutes fell to the ground and rolled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
over and over, growling, spitting, biting, each
trying to get a strangle-hold on the other’s
throat. No quarter was to be given in that
desperate fight. It was to be a battle to the
death.</p>

<p>Bomba, gladdened by his sudden deliverance
when all hope had seemed lost, stepped back out
of reach of the combatants. He felt for his
revolver and found it.</p>

<p>Bomba could see now that Polulu, wearied
from his first victorious battle, was at a disadvantage
against the fresh young puma. The
boy circled about the duelists, seeking for an
opportunity to help the friend who had so loyally
helped him.</p>

<p>The chance came sooner than he had expected.</p>

<p>The young puma sprawled across the back of
Polulu. His fangs sank into the old veteran’s
neck, his teeth seeking the spinal cord. Polulu
rolled over in a desperate attempt to dislodge his
enemy. The movement brought the young puma’s
head directly within the range of Bomba’s
revolver.</p>

<p>Bomba did not hesitate. He fired instantly.
The shot struck the puma in the center of the
forehead.</p>

<p>It did not kill him, but it stunned him and
made him relinquish his grip.</p>

<p>The next instant a second bullet penetrated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
the brain. The brute struggled convulsively for
a moment, then straightened out and lay still.</p>

<p>Bomba went over to Polulu. The old puma
was exhausted and bleeding from a dozen wounds.</p>

<p>Bomba put his arm about the neck of his
friend, and Polulu rubbed his head against the
boy and tried to lick his face.</p>

<p>“Polulu!” exclaimed Bomba, as he caressed
the great head, “you are brave. You are strong.
You are the best of all the beasts of the jungle.”</p>

<p>Polulu purred complacently, as though to say
he knew it.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br>
<span class="fs80">AN UNEXPECTED RECEPTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The puma and the boy rested for a time, while
Polulu licked his wounds, and when Bomba went
on again the puma accompanied him for some
distance through the jungle.</p>

<p>It was getting late, and Bomba began to wonder
whether he would be able to visit the village
of the Araos and return on the same day.</p>

<p>He could spend the night in the jungle, of
course. He had done it many times before and
had not been afraid. Now, especially with Polulu
to guard him, he would be safe enough.</p>

<p>But Casson! There was always Casson. At
any time now he might be made the victim of an
attack by the fierce head-hunters of Nascanora.
And when that time came, if it should come,
Bomba wanted to be at the old man’s side to
live or die with him as fate might determine.</p>

<p>He pushed on as fast as he could, the faithful
Polulu still beside him, the jaboty slung over his
shoulder. He was getting close to the maloca
now, and if there was any chance of accomplishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
his errand and getting back before midnight,
he meant to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Still faster he went, Polulu padding beside
him and keeping away by his presence not only
jungle enemies but Bomba’s friends, the monkeys
and the parrots, who gave him a wide berth when
they saw the grim guardian that kept pace with
him.</p>

<p>When they drew near to the place where
Bomba expected to find the tribe he was searching
for, the boy said good-bye to Polulu, telling him
that if the Indians saw him coming accompanied
by a puma they would consider his visit an
unfriendly one.</p>

<p>Whether Polulu clearly understood this or not,
he knew that he had received his dismissal, and
with a last friendly rub of his tawny head he
disappeared into the jungle. But Bomba had a
feeling that he was hovering somewhere near,
ready at the slightest need to come again to his
help.</p>

<p>Bomba began to be troubled now because he
had no more to take as a present to the Araos
than the jaboty. He had had so much to do in
preserving his life through the course of the
momentous day that he had had but little time
to look for game.</p>

<p>Once he thought that fortune was going to
favor him. It was when he caught sight of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
tapir close to the edge of a small stream. But
the tapir had seen him first and disappeared like
a shadow in the depths of the jungle before
Bomba could bring his weapon into play.</p>

<p>He was greatly disappointed at this. Some
tapir meat would have been a succulent present to
bring to the Araos. Laden with such a gift, he
could hardly have failed to be received with
gratitude and friendship.</p>

<p>However, he had no more time to hunt. He
at least had the jaboty, and he could promise to
bring the natives more game at some future time
if they would let him have the hammocks he
needed.</p>

<p>The sound of a drum rang through the jungle.
Bomba halted, head up, every sense alert.</p>

<p>He was hard upon some Indian maloca, that
was certain. The medicine man of the tribe was
beating the drum to propitiate the particular god
worshipped by his people.</p>

<p>Was it the village of the Araos he was approaching?
It should be, by his reckoning of
time and distance. Yet it was by no means
certain, for these tribes shifted their locations
frequently as they followed the game trails or
searched for better fishing places.</p>

<p>Even if it were some other tribe, however,
Bomba had no reason, he thought, to fear their
active unfriendliness. The head-hunters were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
only real enemies that he was conscious of having
in the jungle.</p>

<p>He went on, therefore, trying to stifle some
vague premonition that was stirring within him.
He had a feeling, an instinct, that something
unpropitious was in the air.</p>

<p>Soon the increasing signs of human habitation
warned him that he was in close proximity to a
village.</p>

<p>In accordance with Indian etiquette, which resents
a sudden intrusion, he clapped his hands
and shouted.</p>

<p>The echo of the shout died away in the forest.
There was no answering call.</p>

<p>Bomba waited stoically, betraying no outward
sign of uneasiness. After a few moments he
shouted more loudly than before.</p>

<p>Still there was no answer, and he began to be
seriously perturbed.</p>

<p>If the Indians had been in a friendly mood,
they would already have sent out a scout to see
who the visitor was, what he wanted, and welcome
him to the maloca.</p>

<p>A third time Bomba shouted. Still no answer.
All the previous sounds of life and activity he had
noted had been hushed, and above everything
hung the silence of the grave.</p>

<p>And now Bomba had the impression that the
jungle was filled with shadowy, furtive forms.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
He felt that each tree and thicket might be hiding
an enemy, ready the next instant to make the
intruder a target for his arrow.</p>

<p>Still the lad remained quietly where he was,
not moving a muscle and showing no signs of
alarm.</p>

<p>There was a slight rustle immediately behind
him, and Bomba turned quickly.</p>

<p>There, where the instant before had been
nothing, stood a dark-skinned Indian, magnificent
in his six-feet-two of brawn and muscle.</p>

<p>The face of the Indian bore no welcoming
smile. On it was a scowl so black that Bomba’s
heart sank within him!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br>
<span class="fs80">BY A HAIR’S BREADTH</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In a moment’s time Bomba had taken a grip
on himself.</p>

<p>He returned the scowl of the Indian with a
flashing smile that showed all his white teeth,
and, beating with his two clenched hands upon
his bronzed chest, cried in a loud voice that held
no sign of quavering:</p>

<p>“Karo Katu Kama-rah!” thus declaring himself
“Good white friend!”</p>

<p>Without any relaxing of his scowl, the Indian
grunted “Ugh” and pointed to the jaboty slung
over Bomba’s shoulder.</p>

<p>The boy took the still living turtle by the bush
cord with which it was tied and held it out to the
Indian.</p>

<p>The latter received it with another grunt, and,
beckoning Bomba to follow, threaded his way
through the bushes to the maloca.</p>

<p>Bomba followed, knowing by a sixth sense that
he was himself being followed and spied upon.
He could feel eyes boring into his back. Yet not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
once did he catch sight of a dark-skinned form,
nor did the cracking of a single twig beneath a
brown foot betray the presence of anyone but
himself and his Indian guide in all the silent
jungle.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they reached the maloca.</p>

<p>It was only a small Indian village, with perhaps
thirty primitive dwellings arranged in circular
fashion about a small clearing.</p>

<p>The “huts” were of the simplest sort. Some
were merely hammocks, swung between two poles.
Palm leaves formed the roof of these rude abodes,
wholly insufficient to shelter their owners from
the mildest of tropical storms.</p>

<p>But the dwelling of the chief was more elaborate.
This was more like the cabin that Bomba
shared with Casson, except that only two sides of
it were enclosed.</p>

<p>The chief met him in the center of the clearing,
surrounded by some dozen stalwart young warriors.
The chief himself was an old man, wizened
and toothless, with an inscrutable expression in
the small eyes he turned upon Bomba.</p>

<p>The latter looked around on the ring of faces.
There was nothing encouraging in them. All
bore scowls similar to that of the scout who had
led him to the maloca.</p>

<p>Bomba stood motionless, the target of all these
unfriendly eyes, while the man who had first met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
him advanced toward the chief and laid the
jaboty at his feet.</p>

<p>There followed a brief harangue in the Indian
tongue that was carried on in so low a tone that
Bomba could not hear what was said.</p>

<p>Then the chief motioned to him to come forward.
Bomba obeyed, his face a perfect mask
for the tumult of emotions that was surging
within him.</p>

<p>The harangue had evidently not helped his
cause. The faces were, if possible, still more
unfriendly, and there were mutterings that
portended an approaching storm.</p>

<p>Could it be that this tribe had made some sort
of treaty with the head-hunters and had joined
with them in the attempt to kill the two whites?</p>

<p>This was possible, Bomba thought, but hardly
likely. There was a deadly antipathy between the
two tribes, and the head-hunters probably planned
to make the Araos their victims as soon as they
had made an end of Casson and himself.</p>

<p>It was much more probable, Bomba thought,
that the visit of the head-hunters to that district
had been laid by the Araos at the door of Casson.
It might have brought to a head all the superstitious
feelings they themselves had entertained
in regard to the old naturalist. Perhaps he was a
Man of Evil, as the head-hunters declared. If
so, he ought to be put out of the way. At any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
rate, if he were killed, perhaps the head-hunters
would go back to the Giant Cataract and trouble
the Araos no more.</p>

<p>In this conjecture Bomba was right. The tribe
was sorely troubled by the incursion of their
dreaded enemies. At any time they might be
attacked and wiped out. If the whites had not
been in that district, the head-hunters would not
have come.</p>

<p>So, on the innocent heads of Casson and Bomba
they were prepared to vent the irritation caused
by this invasion. And here was one of the troublemakers
who had walked right into their hands.
What better opportunity to get him, at least, out
of the way? Casson could be dealt with later.</p>

<p>So Bomba’s instinct had not played him false
when it had warned him that he was in danger.
He read doom on the faces of all that scowling
group.</p>

<p>He knew that to try now to escape would be
useless. A quick glance over his shoulder told
him that all escape was cut off from the rear. A
score or more of Indians had magically appeared
to swell the group, no doubt those who had been
following and spying upon him in the jungle.</p>

<p>The women and children of the tribe had
gathered at one end of the maloca, and were
looking on stoically at the scene.</p>

<p>As Bomba reached the circle of Indians about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
the chief a dozen sinewy hands reached out to
grasp him. In a moment more he would be helpless,
a prisoner where he had expected to be a
guest. And none knew better than Bomba what
it meant to be a prisoner of the Indians.</p>

<p>But before one of the reaching hands could
close upon him there came a shrill cry from
among the group of squaws and maidens.</p>

<p>While all turned in surprise at this unexpected
interruption, a small girl, not more than six or
seven years old, detached herself from the group
and rushed toward Bomba.</p>

<p>While the lad stood amazed and unable to
move, the little thing took his hand in her own
and turned to face the chief.</p>

<p>“Kama-rah!” she exclaimed impetuously.
“Kari Katu Kama-rah!” and touched the white
boy on the chest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br>
<span class="fs80">THE TURN OF THE WHEEL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A babble of excited exclamations broke out at
this sudden intervention of the girl in Bomba’s
behalf.</p>

<p>“Pirah!” said the chief, in a voice where
sternness was mingled with affection. “Da-rah!”</p>

<p>But Pirah showed no intention of going away.
She stamped her foot and clung the more tightly
to Bomba’s hand.</p>

<p>The boy recognized her then as the youngest
child of the chief, Hondura. He had seen her
more than once when he had skirted the village
in some of his hunting excursions.</p>

<p>Although the women of the jungle are as a
rule even more stolid than the men, Pirah promised
to be an exception to the rule.</p>

<p>She it was who liked to play at hunting,
shouldering a bow as big as herself and learning
to shoot at a target when her baby hands could
barely stretch the strings.</p>

<p>Her fire and spirit and playful antics had
amused the old chief, who scarcely checked her in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
anything, and the little Pirah had gradually grown
into the spoiled and petted darling of the tribe.</p>

<p>But now, when she espoused the cause of
Bomba, who had come perhaps to put the tribe
under the spell of Casson, the Man of Evil, the
thing was too serious to be laughed at, even by
the doting father.</p>

<p>There were dark looks on the faces of the
younger warriors, and hands were again outstretched
to seize Bomba.</p>

<p>But the eyes of the little maiden flashed and
she pushed the nearest Indian away with her tiny
hand.</p>

<p>“Kama-rah!” she cried again, appealing to her
father.</p>

<p>But Hondura scowled, and his black face so
frightened Pirah that she shrank back against
Bomba.</p>

<p>“Da-rah!” again commanded her father, and
this time the child obeyed and went back weeping
to the group of women.</p>

<p>With his little defender gone, strong hands
gripped Bomba and drew him within the ring of
savages.</p>

<p>Bomba felt that this was the end.</p>

<p>But again there came an interruption. Peto,
the shaman, or medicine man, of the tribe, came
up to Bomba in a slow dreamy way, eyes closed,
as though he were walking in his sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>The braves fell back before this man of
mystery.</p>

<p>Peto took hold of Bomba and began to feel all
over him, his face, his hands, his chest, his legs.</p>

<p>Then Peto went into a violent spasm, twitching
and trembling, showing the whites of his eyes and
foaming at the mouth.</p>

<p>Bomba had stood the hauling and mauling
without protest, though without much hope of
any good coming from it.</p>

<p>The old medicine man broke out into a babble
of words, sometimes almost beneath his breath,
again rising to a shrill scream.</p>

<p>The Indians watched him breathlessly, though
they sought to repress any show of emotion.</p>

<p>Peto continued to open and shut his eyes
rapidly, while the muscles of his face twitched
convulsively. At times he would reach out and
pinch Bomba’s legs until the lad winced.</p>

<p>Finally, when Bomba had begun to feel that
he could not stand the strain much longer, the
shaman opened his eyes, looked straight at the
lad, and cried at the top of his cracked voice:</p>

<p>“Kari Katu Kama-rah!”</p>

<p>The words had a magical effect upon the
Indians. The scowls disappeared instantly from
their faces and they echoed in chorus:</p>

<p>“Kari Katu Kama-rah!”</p>

<p>Bomba was saved. Peto had declared that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
jungle boy was a friend, and Hondura and his
braves were willing to accept the medicine man’s
word.</p>

<p>The chief motioned Bomba to him, and the boy
squatted beside him on the ground. The men of
the tribe gathered around, as friendly now as
they had been antagonistic before. Gone was
their warlike attitude. The change was kaleidoscopic.</p>

<p>It had been a matter of touch and go. Bomba
marveled at his good fortune in winning Peto’s
approval. Apart from saving his life for the
present, it would have other consequences. It
was no light matter to have the Araos on his side,
in view of the presence of the head-hunters on
their deadly mission.</p>

<p>While the chief was questioning Bomba, the
little maiden Pirah lingered wistfully on the
outside of the group.</p>

<p>After a while Hondura called her to him. The
little one came timidly and sat down beside Bomba
and again took his hand in hers.</p>

<p>Bomba smiled down at her and Pirah smiled
back. There were so few smiles ever bestowed
on the lonely boy that it warmed his heart.</p>

<p>The chief seemed pleased, and looked at
Bomba with a more friendly expression than
before.</p>

<p>To Bomba’s inquiries about Nascanora and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
people Hondura replied that the chief of the
head-hunters had visited him and professed
friendship with the Araos. Hondura knew,
though, that Nascanora’s heart was black and that
the invaders were only trying to lull him into
security until they were ready to fall on his people
and wipe them out. But he was watchful and his
braves were ready.</p>

<p>“Did Nascanora say anything about Casson?”
Bomba asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes. Nascanora wanted one of my Araos
to go with him as guide to point out the location
of Casson’s hut. But I, Hondura, professed
ignorance and Nascanora frowned. But finally
he went away with words of friendship.”</p>

<p>Hondura admitted that he, too, had thought
that Casson might be a Man of Evil, as Nascanora
had said. But now that Peto had spoken, he
knew that Casson and Bomba were good. So he,
Hondura, would do nothing to aid Nascanora
in his designs against the whites.</p>

<p>This was balm to Bomba’s anxious soul. The
chief object of his mission had been accomplished.
Casson would be glad.</p>

<p>The matter of the hammocks was simple.
Hondura would have given him half a dozen if
Bomba had wanted them. But the boy accepted
only the two, and these were brought at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
command of the chief and tied up in a light
bundle.</p>

<p>It required considerable diplomacy for Bomba
to terminate his visit quickly without offense.
They were for having him stay with them for that
night, several nights if he would. But Bomba
managed to impress them with the necessity of his
getting back to Casson at once, and they
reluctantly yielded.</p>

<p>The chief had noticed that Bomba’s arrows
were all gone, and as a parting proof of friendship
insisted on supplying him with a dozen choice
ones from his own stock.</p>

<p>Thanking him warmly and promising to return
again within a short time bringing gifts, Bomba
took leave of Hondura and little Pirah, who clung
to him up to the last moment.</p>

<p>Several of the younger warriors, as a mark of
courtesy, accompanied him some distance into the
jungle, and when they finally left him repeated
the words of Peto, “Kari Katu Kama-rah!”</p>

<p>Bomba responded earnestly and with a grateful
heart, and when they disappeared like ghosts in
the shadows he was conscious of a still deeper
sense of the loneliness that of late had become
his constant companion.</p>

<p>The jungle seemed to him unnaturally still.
The screaming of the parrots was less strident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
than usual and the chattering of the monkeys
sounded muffled and far away.</p>

<p>His eyes fell on the track of a tapir, and this
roused him from his musings. He followed it
for a short distance, and came upon his quarry so
suddenly that he almost betrayed his presence.
But the wind was blowing toward him, and he had
made no sound.</p>

<p>The tapir was standing with his side toward
him, offering as good a target as any hunter
could wish.</p>

<p>Bomba fitted one of Hondura’s arrows to his
bow and let fly.</p>

<p>The missile sped swift and true. It struck the
tapir at the base of the skull, and the animal
toppled over and died with scarcely a struggle.</p>

<p>Bomba covered the distance between him and
his prey in a few leaps.</p>

<p>Good luck, thought Bomba. He would have
something good to take back to the hut. It
would be good to have meat again, after living
so long on the eggs of the jaboty.</p>

<p>He cut choice steaks from the carcass with his
machete. These he wrapped in leaves, bound
with bush cord and slung with the hammocks over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>Bomba was jubilant. The day was ending in
accordance with his fondest hopes. He had
gained the friendship of the Araos and put an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
obstacle in the way of Nascanora. He had with
him hammocks, the comfort of which he and
Casson had sadly missed. He had replenished
his stock of arrows. And there was the tapir
meat, which would make a fine meal for them
both, roasted on a stout stick held over a blazing
fire. Yes, it had been a good day!</p>

<p>The thought of food moved Bomba to still
greater speed. He had eaten nothing since morning
except a handful of roasted Brazil nuts that
Pirah had thrust into his hand at parting, and he
was ravenous.</p>

<p>For another hour he pressed rapidly through
the jungle, his eyes sharply scanning every tree
and covert, for dusk was coming on and the beasts
of prey would soon be starting on their nightly
mission of death.</p>

<p>Suddenly his steps slackened, for that instinct
of his that he had learned to trust warned him of
danger. It was in the air. He did not know
just what form it was taking, but he knew that,
whatever it was, it was near at hand.</p>

<p>As silently now as a panther he glided on, not
a twig snapping beneath his sandaled feet.</p>

<p>Soon a smell of a campfire warned him of
human proximity. He crept cautiously nearer
and, peering through the undergrowth, saw dark
forms squatting about a fire. He edged a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
nearer until he could hear fragments of their
guttural speech.</p>

<p>Bomba dropped on his stomach and wormed
his way through the brush until he reached the
outermost edge of the zone of light cast by the
fire. Then from his screen he slowly raised his
head and looked.</p>

<p>There were thirty or more savages seated in
council. One of them he recognized as the man
he had met in the forest at the crossing of the
trails.</p>

<p>These, then, were the head-hunters, the men
who were seeking Casson’s death and his own!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br>
<span class="fs80">WORDS OF DOOM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bomba’s eyes swept round the circle and rested
on the scarred, hideous face of a powerful savage,
the symbols on whose chest proclaimed him chief.</p>

<p>He knew it was his arch-enemy, Nascanora!</p>

<p>Bomba drew a long breath and thanked the
jungle instinct that had warned him of danger and
kept him from blundering right into the hands
of the enemy.</p>

<p>Some sort of incantation had evidently been in
progress, as was manifest from the presence of a
kettle over the fire in which the medicine man had
been stirring his horrid brew. The shaman had
now desisted, and had reported to the chief the
will of his gods.</p>

<p>That it fitted in with the chief’s plans was
shown by the words that fell from Nascanora’s
lips.</p>

<p>“Cody Casson,” he said. “The gods say he is
Man of Evil. He bring trouble to the tribe. He
must die.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” came in a concerted grunt of assent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
from the men squatted on their haunches about
the fire.</p>

<p>Bomba lay motionless, his heart thumping
against his ribs. He had come at an opportune
moment. He would learn the plans of the enemy.</p>

<p>So they would kill Casson, would they? Well,
they would have to kill Bomba first. His lips
drew back from his teeth, and his fingers sought
his knife.</p>

<p>“We know now where Casson live,” the chief
went on. “Morana found the place. He tell us
wild boy Bomba is away. Casson is alone. We
go now. Catch Man of Evil. We bring him
here——”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” his followers cried again on a higher
note of excitement. “We go. Now!”</p>

<p>“We take Man of Evil,” cried Nascanora, the
scowl on his distorted features horrible to see.
“We tie him to tree. We make fire,” he made
a gesture as though his hands held flint and steel.
“We burn Cody Casson. Then Man of Evil bring
not bad things to tribe of Nascanora.”</p>

<p>Bomba waited to hear no more.</p>

<p>Swiftly, noiselessly, still flat upon his stomach,
he backed out through the heavy underbrush and
tangle of vines. He knew that not only his life
but that of Casson depended on his getting away
without letting Nascanora guess at his presence
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>When he had got far enough away to think it
safe for him to rise to his feet, he was startled
by a great noise of shouting that swelled into a
fiendish shriek.</p>

<p>He thought at first that they must have discovered
him, despite his caution, and were in
pursuit. But he had been so careful that he dismissed
this for another solution.</p>

<p>The shout must mean that the pow-wow was
over, and that they were getting ready to start
for the hut where Casson waited for Bomba,
alone and unprotected.</p>

<p>Setting off with strides like those of a deer,
Bomba vowed that he would outrace the Indians.
He must get to the hut before them, or Casson
was lost.</p>

<p>But the Indians, too, were swift and adept in
getting through the jungle. Knowing that they
would take the most direct trail, Bomba was
forced to choose a more circuitous one.</p>

<p>His chief hope lay in his extraordinary fleetness
of foot. If this did not fail him and if he
met with no other mishaps in the jungle, he might
yet be able to reach the hut and make some preparations
for defense before Nascanora and his
followers reached it on their errand of destruction.</p>

<p>He made his way with desperate energy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
all the speed he could infuse into his legs, pausing
for no obstacle great or small.</p>

<p>In the course he had chosen lay a primitive
bridge that had been placed across one of the
streams that abounded in the region. The bridge
consisted simply of the trunk of a mirity palm,
wet and slippery from the recent storm.</p>

<p>If Bomba had followed his usual custom on
such occasions and kicked off his sandals, so that
his bare feet might get a grip on the log, he could
have passed over it in perfect safety, as he had
done hundreds of times before.</p>

<p>But so frantic was his haste and so great his
belief in his ability to maintain his balance on any
footing, however precarious, that this time he
did not stop to remove his sandals.</p>

<p>He had traversed almost the entire length of
the bridge and had nearly reached the further
shore when he slipped and fell, scrambling and
kicking, into the water.</p>

<p>It would not have been so bad if in the fall he
had not struck his head against the log. This
dazed him for a moment, but the shock of the
water revived him and brought him to the surface
sputtering and furious.</p>

<p>He struck out strongly for the shore, but at the
same moment something bit viciously at his leg.
Bomba knew at once what it was—the saw-toothed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
piranha, the voracious fish that abounds
in all the tributaries of the Amazon.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for Bomba that he had been
so close to the farther shore when he fell. A few
vigorous strokes, and he reached the shore. As
he drew himself up, another piranha caught his
foot in its vice-like jaws and hung on grimly, even
after Bomba had drawn himself clear of the
water.</p>

<p>Bomba kicked out viciously, and the fish
loosened its hold and dropped back into the water.
The boy scarcely took time to examine his
wounds, though they were very painful and, he
knew, would be still worse on the following day.
That was, he thought, with a stab at his heart,
if he should ever see the light of the next day!</p>

<p>He was furious with himself. Bomba, to have
lost his footing on the bridge, Bomba, who had
always prided himself on being so sure-footed!
The mishap had delayed him seriously. Perhaps
it had sealed Casson’s doom and his own.</p>

<p>The journey seemed never-ending as he pressed
on, spurring his jaded muscles to the utmost. He
was faint from hunger and wearied by the many
adventures of that exciting day. His feet felt
as if they were weighted with lead. The one
that had been bitten by the piranha was already
badly swollen, and every step was accompanied by
a torturing pang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>And to this physical pain was added the agony
of apprehension that with every moment became
more acute. Had his enemies preceded him?
Had they perhaps already reached the hut?</p>

<p>At last he reached the vicinity of the hut.
The crisis was at hand. Perturbed as he was in
mind, his jungle cunning did not desert him.</p>

<p>He drifted toward the location of the hut like
a shadow. Not a twig snapped under his feet to
betray him. He dropped on his hands and knees
and crept in this position for a hundred yards to
a little elevation from which he would be able to
look down directly on the hut. Reaching the
spot, he parted the vines and looked through.</p>

<p>It was so dark now that none but jungle-trained
eyes could have distinguished anything in the
dense pall of blackness. But Bomba had eyes
almost as keen as those of Polulu.</p>

<p>Not a sound broke the heavy silence of the
night. But for Bomba’s eyes, he might have
exulted in the thought that he had outstripped the
Indians in the race, that he had reached the hut
in time to warn Casson.</p>

<p>But there was a shadow near the hut, and at
little distances were other shadows completely
encircling it—a sinister ring of threatened death.</p>

<p>Bomba’s heart beat faster, his breath seemed
almost to whistle through his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>The odds were fearful ones—thirty to two at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
least, really thirty to one, for Casson could not be
relied on in his half-demented state, and whatever
fighting was done would probably have to be
done by Bomba.</p>

<p>The jungle boy thought quickly. Force alone
would not avail. He must use strategy, even as
he had used it in the case of the cooanaradi.</p>

<p>But what and how? He racked his agonized
brain, seizing at some expedient only to dismiss
it the next moment as futile. And every instant
he expected to hear the bloodcurdling war whoop
of the savages as they rushed the cabin.</p>

<p>Then like a flash it came to him!</p>

<p>With incredible swiftness, still on hands and
knees, he made his way to a hollow tree. This
had been his playroom since his earliest childhood,
and in its trunk Bomba had stored many of his
treasures.</p>

<p>Chief among these was the skin of a great
anaconda, slain by Casson many years ago. It
had had a great fascination for Bomba, and many
a time he had arrayed himself in it, dragging its
great length behind him. Often he had used it
to scare playfully his friends of the jungle.</p>

<p>The monkeys and parrots had fled in dismay,
and when Bomba had cast it aside had returned
timidly and looked at him reproachfully for having
played a practical joke upon them. Polulu
had bared his teeth when he first saw it, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
sheepishly abandoned his hostile attitude when
Bomba had emerged and laughed at him.</p>

<p>Now it was to serve for something sterner
than play. Bomba’s face was grim as he got into
the great skin and wrapped the front part of it
about his head and shoulders.</p>

<p>The dried head, with the great jaws gaping,
had been retained in its entirety, and Bomba held
this before his face as he prepared to emerge from
his hiding place. The horrible object was one
calculated to strike terror to the stoutest heart.</p>

<p>But for the full success of the stratagem light
was needed. The Indians must see the fearsome
thing in all its ghastliness.</p>

<p>Bomba felt about for one of the pine knots
that in earlier days he had used to illuminate his
play place. He found one, full of resin, and,
concealed by the tree, lighted the torch. In a
moment it was blazing brightly.</p>

<p>With a weird, hideous scream that rang
through the silent jungle and startled it into a
hundred echoes, Bomba left his shelter, flinging
the torch ahead of him and dashed down upon
that sinister ring of figures about the hut.</p>

<p>The ruse worked. There were shrieks of terror,
and the savages gave way before the horrible
vision of a snake that ran on two feet and made
a noise like the screaming of demons!</p>

<p>The way to the hut was clear. In a few great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
bounds Bomba had reached it and catapulted
himself through the doorway.</p>

<p>With a hoarse cry Casson grasped a spear that
leaned against the wall near at hand and raised it
on high.</p>

<p>“No, no, Casson! Do not strike!” gasped the
boy, as he let the empty snake skin slip from him
to the floor. “It is I, Bomba! Look!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br>
<span class="fs80">AGAINST FEARFUL ODDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>An exclamation of amazement and relief fell
from the old naturalist as he lowered the spear.</p>

<p>“But why—what—” he stammered, as he lay
the weapon aside.</p>

<p>“The Indians!” panted Bomba, as he slammed
the door shut and slipped into place the heavy
bar he had fashioned while he was rebuilding the
hut. “Nascanora and his head-hunters! They
are here. You heard their cries. They have
come to get you, to burn you in a fire.”</p>

<p>A light of comprehension came into Casson’s
old faded eyes.</p>

<p>“But they shall not,” he cried, with a flare of
the old courage and energy in which Bomba had
formerly taken pride and which he had never
expected to see again. “We will fight. I do not
much care for myself; but if they kill me, they
will kill you, too. And they shall not do it! We
will beat them off!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Bomba, his eyes kindling. “But
they are many. We shall have to fight hard. We
will fight with bows and arrows. And when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
are gone, we will fight some more, you with the
spear and I with the fire stick. And the machete,
too, will be good. Yes, we will fight.”</p>

<p>For a time, however, it seemed that it might
not be necessary to fight. After the first howls
of fright and the frantic scurrying of the Indians
before that awful apparition, a deep silence again
fell on the jungle.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and still the hush continued.</p>

<p>In the truce thus gained, Bomba and Casson
made all the preparations possible for the battle
that seemed imminent. The old man, under the
stimulus of the danger threatening them, regained
something of his old energy and power to think
and act.</p>

<p>How long this would continue Bomba did not
know. But he was thankful for the change. It
gave him a sense of comradeship, a relief from
bearing a dead weight, and infused him with new
heart and hope. How much Casson would be
able to accomplish was of course conjectural, but
there was a chance that even his feeble help might
turn the scale of battle.</p>

<p>Together they got out their stock of arrows
and laid them within easy reach. Bomba fully
loaded the revolver and opened all his boxes of
cartridges. The boy, in reconstructing the cabin,
had made loopholes on all four sides through
which the weapons could be discharged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>He took advantage now of the lull, and ate
some handfuls of rice and raw maize and drank
copious draughts of water. It was but a meager
meal, but it refreshed him wonderfully.</p>

<p>Still the silence persisted, and the little garrison
felt some perplexity.</p>

<p>“Do you think they may have gone away?”
whispered Casson, with a little accent of hope.</p>

<p>Bomba shook his head.</p>

<p>“I do not think so,” he answered in the same
low tone. “They have come too far. They will
not go back without trying to kill us. At first
they thought the snake was magic. They were
afraid. But Nascanora will talk to them big
words and they will come back. We shall have
to fight.”</p>

<p>The last word had scarcely left Bomba’s lips
when a terrific chorus of yells rang out and a
concerted rush of savages was made on the door
of the cabin.</p>

<p>The door bent, but the stout bar of lignum
vitæ, almost as strong as iron, refused to break.</p>

<p>Bomba leaped to his feet and grasped his bow.
He fitted an arrow to the string and took aim
through a porthole at the nearest figure.</p>

<p>The bow twanged. The arrow whistled on its
way. There was a wild scream from the Indian,
who threw up his hands and plunged forward on
his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>Casson had also snatched a bow and essayed to
follow Bomba’s example. But his sight was defective
and his hand tremulous, and the missile
failed to find a target.</p>

<p>But one of the Indians had fallen anyway, and
although this counted for little when the number
of their foes was considered, the moral effect was
on the side of the besieged. They had got in the
first blow and served notice on the attackers that
they would have to pay in lives for whatever they
got.</p>

<p>The shadowy figures had disappeared as
though by magic, seeking shelter behind the trees
that fringed the clearing.</p>

<p>Bomba could hear the sound of axes. His
enemies were cutting down a tree. For what
purpose?</p>

<p>The question was quickly answered. A dozen
savages emerged from the shadows, bearing between
them a heavy log ten feet long, with the
evident purpose of using it as a battering ram
to beat in the door.</p>

<p>Bomba knew that if they succeeded in this,
Casson and he were lost. Once let that horde
invade the cabin, and nothing could avail against
overpowering numbers.</p>

<p>No time for arrows now. He had a far
quicker weapon at hand. The white man’s fire
stick!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>They were so near that he could not miss. So
swiftly that the repeated detonations blended into
one continuous report, he emptied the five chambers
of the revolver.</p>

<p>At that close range every shot took its toll in
dead and wounded. Several fell, others staggered
back to the shelter of the woods. Among the
wounded Bomba recognized the towering figure
of Nascanora. The log went down with a crash,
and the survivors of those who had been carrying
it fled in panic.</p>

<p>It was not only the execution done, but the
way it had been done that filled them with fright.
Few of them had ever before heard the report of
a firearm—perhaps none of them. The spurts
of flame and the roar of the weapon confirmed
their conviction that the hut was the habitation
of wizards.</p>

<p>A snake that walked on two feet! Fire that
spoke and killed! What chance had they with
their bows and arrows, especially when they could
not see their targets?</p>

<p>Bomba handed the revolver to Casson to reload,
and in the meantime fitted another arrow
to his bow. But though he strained his eyes
through the darkness, he could find nothing at
which to shoot.</p>

<p>For a long time there was silence about the
hut, and now for the first time Bomba permitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
himself to hope that their foes had withdrawn,
for that night at least, and perhaps permanently.
Their losses had been serious. The threat of
the battering ram had failed. Perhaps they had
had enough of the contest.</p>

<p>But this conjecture had not thoroughly taken
into account the resources and ingenuity of
Nascanora.</p>

<p>From the woods came something in a trail of
flame, and the next moment there was a soft thud
in the logs that formed the wall.</p>

<p>Several others followed in quick succession.
And now the ground immediately in front of the
hut was streaked with flickering shafts of light
that momentarily grew brighter.</p>

<p>Casson was mystified.</p>

<p>“What are they doing?” he asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>Bomba had been asking himself that question,
too. And now the solution came to him, and his
heart sank.</p>

<p>“They are arrows with fire in their tails,” he
answered. “They are trying to burn the hut.”</p>

<p>For a moment despair clutched their hearts.
This was something on which they had not
counted, something against which they had no
way to fight.</p>

<p>Bomba’s first impulse was to dash outside the
door and tear down the burning arrows. But he
realized at once that this would be suicide. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
the light that came from the torches he would
offer a perfect target and a dozen arrows would
be buried in his body.</p>

<p>Now the two within the hut heard an ominous
crackling which told them that the wall was
catching fire. It grew louder and louder. It
seemed to spell their doom.</p>

<p>They were in a fearful plight. If they stayed
inside, they would be burned to death. If they
rushed outside, nothing could save them from the
arrows of their invisible foes.</p>

<p>Invisible! It was this that made Bomba grind
his teeth in rage. He had often faced death, but
on those occasions he had seen his foes and had
had his chance of selling his life dearly. Now
even this poor privilege would be denied him. He
and Casson would be shot down with perfect
impunity by the enemies behind the trees. Long
before he could reach them, he would have
fallen.</p>

<p>Other arrows with their fire trails had followed
the first flight, and Bomba knew by the increasing
light on the ground that the wall must be studded
with them.</p>

<p>The crackling now was becoming a roar, and
Bomba could tell that the logs themselves were
afire. Spurts of flame began to creep through
the cracks, and the heat became unbearable.</p>

<p>He and Casson tried to beat out the interior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
blaze with boards, but for every flame they extinguished
a dozen more appeared. The wall had
fairly caught, and the fire was beyond their control.
The end seemed very near.</p>

<p>Bomba mentally said farewell to life. It was
hard to die right on the threshold of life. All
his dreams had faded. He would never see the
white men again, never solve the mystery of his
existence.</p>

<p>Their hands and faces now were blistered by
the heat, and they were forced to retreat to the
farther part of the hut. There was a little water
there, and they dashed it over them. Then they
drenched some cloths that they wrapped around
their necks and faces.</p>

<p>“Bomba, my boy!” said Casson, in one of his
rare expressions of affection. “I’m an old man,
and weary. But you’re a lad and should live on.”
The old man went on, but now the words became
mere muttering.</p>

<p>Hope now was gone. They could not help
themselves and there was none to help them.</p>

<p>None to help them?</p>

<p>Bomba started as though from an electric
shock.</p>

<p>He sprang to one of the portholes and sent out
a loud, long, undulating cry that rang weirdly
through the jungle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>Again and again he repeated the cry with all
the power of his lungs.</p>

<p>It was the call that he had used many times to
summon his jungle friends to his side, and they
had always come!</p>

<p>Would they come now?</p>

<p>Would they face fire?</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br>
<span class="fs80">IN THE NICK OF TIME</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The jungle beasts came in swarms!</p>

<p>In the distance could be heard something like
the soughing of a great wind. It grew in volume
until it swelled into a roar. Then the jungle
about the hut was alive with monkeys, scores of
them, hundreds of them, with every passing moment
increasing their numbers.</p>

<p>They saw the burning hut, and sensed Bomba’s
extremity. They saw the lurking savages, and
realized that they were Bomba’s foes.</p>

<p>Then there came pouring down from the trees
a hail of the heavy castanha nuts that felled
whatever they struck.</p>

<p>The surviving savages fled, with wild screams,
in a headlong rout. And their demoralization
was complete when Polulu, with a tremendous
roar, came bounding in upon them, his eyes glaring,
his tail lashing, his paws striking out like
flails.</p>

<p>Bomba heard the shrieks of the affrighted savages,
the jabbering of the monkeys, and the roars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
of Polulu. His jungle friends had not failed him.
He and Casson were saved!</p>

<p>With smarting eyes he rushed to the door,
threw off the heavy bar and swung the door wide.</p>

<p>Then he ran back to Casson, who was in a half
comatose condition, pulled him to his feet and,
half dragging, half lifting him, staggered through
the doorway and laid his burden under the trees.</p>

<p>What blessed coolness was in the night air
as Bomba drank it in deep draughts! And what
added delight came to him as he felt on his uplifted
face the plashing of raindrops!</p>

<p>Casson was now in a state of complete collapse,
and Bomba was frightened at the ashen
pallor of the old man’s face. He rushed to the
river behind the cabin and brought water, with
which he bathed Casson’s face. Then he chafed
his wrists and slapped his hands, until the naturalist
opened his eyes with a feeble moan.</p>

<p>The monkeys were all excitement, and chattered
their sympathy with Casson and their delight
at Bomba’s escape. They would have come
down and surrounded the pair, had it not been
for the presence of Polulu, who had returned
from his pursuit of the savages and who now
came up to Bomba and rubbed his great head
against him.</p>

<p>Then the puma stretched himself on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
ground at a little distance, and Bomba knew as
well as if he had been told that his faithful
guardian was settled there for the night. Woe to
any skulking savage who might steal back there
while Polulu was on guard!</p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, there was no further
attack to be apprehended that night, nor for
many more to come. The Indians had paid
heavy toll. Five lay dead on the ground, and
probably twice that number in wounded had
crawled away into the forest or been carried off
by their comrades.</p>

<p>At least half of the raiders had been incapacitated,
and among the wounded had been
Nascanora himself, and all the unwounded survivors
were at that moment rushing pell-mell
through the jungle, frantically eager to put as
many miles as possible between themselves and
the cabin, where the white man’s magic had been
capped by the calling of the jungle beasts to help.</p>

<p>As soon as Casson had been restored to consciousness
and Bomba had bandaged his burns as
well as he could, the lad turned his attention to
the cabin.</p>

<p>But there was nothing he could do that nature
was not doing still better. The rain was now
coming down in torrents. It deluged the burning
front wall until the blaze died out and great
clouds of steam took its place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>Fortunately, the other three walls had caught
in only a few places, and here, too, the flames
were quickly extinguished.</p>

<p>The monkeys gradually dispersed after Bomba
told them how grateful he was for their help and
promised to soon see them again.</p>

<p>The storm increased in violence, and Bomba
helped Casson into the hut. The roof had held
and the floor was dry. Bomba made the old man
as comfortable as he could in one of the new
hammocks he had brought with him, and then
crept into the other to get the rest he so badly
needed and had so richly earned.</p>

<p>The last thing he was conscious of, as he
dropped off to sleep, was that Polulu had come
in and stretched his huge form across the
doorway.</p>

<p>Bomba slept late, and when at last he opened
his eyes the faithful puma had gone. He had
stayed until all danger was over and then gone
forth to his hunting.</p>

<p>Bomba himself was stiff and sore, but all concern
for himself was quickly lost in his anxiety
over Casson’s condition. The terrible experience
through which he had passed had been too much
for the old naturalist, and he was in a high fever.
He did not recognize Bomba, and babbled incoherently
in delirium. At intervals he would
sink into a stupor that would endure for hours,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
to be broken again by wild tossings and meaningless
phrases.</p>

<p>At times the words “Bartow” and “Laura”
would escape his lips, but though Bomba listened
eagerly for what would follow, nothing came that
made more clear for him the mystery in which
he was enshrouded.</p>

<p>The boy nursed Casson assiduously, using the
simple but effective remedies whose power he had
learned from Candido, the half-witted caboclo,
and at the end of several days the fever broke.</p>

<p>From then on Casson mended rapidly, and
Bomba was delighted to note that with returning
strength his mind seemed less clouded. He had
lost some of his apathy, and took a greater interest
in the things about him.</p>

<p>The “door” was still closed, but he was trying
harder to open it than he had before. At times
a flash of memory seemed to come to him, and he
would begin to speak eagerly, but before he had
fairly framed a sentence the thought would elude
him. At such times he was desperate, and would
break out into a passion of weeping.</p>

<p>One day he called Bomba to him.</p>

<p>“Bomba,” he said, laying his thin hand on the
boy’s shoulder, “I have tried and tried to tell
you what you have a right to know, but I cannot
remember. Sometimes I almost recall it, and
then it vanishes. But there has come to me a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
name. There is someone who knows, and he can
tell you much, perhaps all.”</p>

<p>“Who is it?” cried Bomba excitedly.</p>

<p>“It is Jojasta,” replied Casson. “Mark well
that name, Jojasta.”</p>

<p>“I will never forget it,” said Bomba solemnly.
“But what is he and where does he live?”</p>

<p>“He is the Medicine Man of the Moving
Mountain,” replied Casson.</p>

<p>“The Moving Mountain?” repeated Bomba,
in bewilderment. He had never heard the term
before.</p>

<p>“It is a long way off,” explained Casson. “And
it is hard to reach. But I will tell you how to
get there. Yes, I know that now. But the other
is too far away. That I cannot recall. Through
Jojasta is the only way you can find out what
you want to know, what you ought to know. You
must go.”</p>

<p>How Bomba went there, the fearful perils he
met, and the obstacles he surmounted on the
way, will be told in the next volume of this series,
entitled: “Bomba, the Jungle Boy, at the Moving
Mountain; or, The Mystery of the Caves of
Fire.”</p>

<p>Casson sank back exhausted, and Bomba knew
there was nothing more to be told just then. But
what he had heard filled him with hope.</p>

<p>He must tell his friends and let them share<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
his joy. He took his harmonica and strayed off
into the jungle, playing a dreamy, plaintive tune.</p>

<p>Soon his jungle friends of the air and treetops
were all about him, Kiki, Woowoo, Doto, and
scores of others. He smiled at them, talked and
played for them. He was in a joyous, exhilarated
mood, and they were glad for Bomba’s sake.</p>

<p>“You are all my friends,” he cried. “You
helped Bomba when the men with bad hearts
came to the cabin. Bomba loves you all. He
does not want to leave you, but he must go. He
will always think of you, and some day he may
come back to you. But Bomba must go. He
must find the men who have souls, the souls that
are awake. For Bomba has a soul. And he must
find the white men. For Bomba is white.”</p>

<p>He tore the puma skin aside and displayed his
chest.</p>

<p>“Look, Woowoo! Look, Kiki! Look, Doto!”
he cried, in an ecstasy of joy and pride. “Look,
all of you! I will tell Polulu, too. I am white!
Bomba is white!”</p>

Dexter books are detective stories, yet they are
without the objectionable features of the impossible
characters and absurd situations that mark
so many of the books in that class. These stories
deal with the up-to-date adventures of a normal,
healthy lad who has a great desire to solve mysteries,
and the volumes relate in an entertaining
way how he does it.</em></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
